Amazon Bedrock is rapidly becoming a go-to platform for developers building AI-powered applications. With its recent introduction of API keys, getting started with Bedrock is now easier than ever. In this post, we’ll break down what this change means, why it matters, and how it can streamline your AI development journey.

## **What’s New: API Keys for Amazon Bedrock**

Amazon Bedrock now lets you generate **API keys** directly from its console. These keys act as simple, secure “passes” that you can use in your code or tools to access Bedrock’s powerful AI features—no complex setup required.

## **The Old Way: IAM Setup**

Previously, connecting to Amazon Bedrock involved several steps:

* Setting up an identity in AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management) or AWS IAM Identity Center
    
* Assigning the correct permissions and policies
    
* Generating and managing security credentials (like access keys and secret keys)
    
* Using these credentials in your code or tools
    

For many developers, especially those new to AWS, this process was **complicated and time-consuming**.

## **The New Way: API Keys**

With API keys, you can:

* **Generate a key in minutes** from the Bedrock console
    
* Choose between **short-term** (for extra security) and **long-term** keys (for convenience)
    
* Use the key directly in your code or with your favorite tools
    

**In short:** You can now start building or testing AI apps on Bedrock almost instantly, without needing to become an AWS IAM expert.

## **Why This Matters**

* **Faster Onboarding:** Get started with Bedrock in minutes, not hours.
    
* **Less Complexity:** No need to dive into IAM roles and policies just to try out Bedrock.
    
* **Easier Integration:** Many popular tools and frameworks support API key authentication, making it easier to connect Bedrock to your workflow.
    
* **Flexible Security:** Choose the type of key that fits your needs, and manage them easily from the console.
    

## **What Changes for Developers?**

* **Generate an API key** from the Bedrock console.
    
* **Use the key** in your code or set it as an environment variable—the Bedrock SDK will handle the rest.
    
* **Admins** still have full control over access and security, but onboarding is now much simpler for everyone.
    

## **Quick Comparison: Old vs. New**

| **Step** | **Old Way (IAM)** | **New Way (API Keys)** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Setup Time | Slow, multi-step | Fast, one-step |
| Required Knowledge | AWS IAM, policies, roles | Just Bedrock console |
| Integration | Sometimes tricky | Simple, API key-based |
| Security Options | Advanced, but complex | Flexible, easy to manage |

## **Bottom Line**

**Amazon Bedrock API keys are a game-changer for AI developers on AWS.** They make it faster, easier, and more accessible to build with Bedrock, whether you’re prototyping, testing, or scaling to production.
