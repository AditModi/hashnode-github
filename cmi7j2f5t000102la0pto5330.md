### Making Programmatic Access as Easy as Checking Email

Imagine this: you just got access to your company’s shared email inbox. Every morning you log in with your username & password, check what’s new, send replies. But when you try to send emails with a script, you still need to request a special email-token, manually rotate it, and keep it safe. Annoying, right?

Now with this feature from AWS CLI and SDKs, you can use *the same credentials you use for the AWS Management Console* to get temporary programmatic access. No more creating separate access keys, no long-term secrets lying around.

---

### What’s New

* Developers can now use their **existing console sign-in credentials** (IAM user, root, or federated role) to authenticate with the CLI or SDKs.
    
* A new `aws login` command (CLI version 2.32.0+) opens your browser, you sign in to the console, and then temporary credentials are generated for your CLI/SDK sessions.
    
* The temporary credentials are automatically rotated and have bounded lifetime (so you’re not stuck with long-lived credentials).
    
* This is available in **all commercial AWS Regions**.
    

---

### Why It Matters (Practical Context)

* **Less risk**: Long-term AWS access keys are a common security leak. This removes that vector for developer machines.
    
* **Faster onboarding**: A new developer logs in with their usual console credentials, runs `aws login`, and they’re ready to use CLI/SDKs — no key requests.
    
* **Unified identity**: Use the same identity and permissions model for console + programmatic access — fewer moving parts and fewer mistakes.
    
* **Better auditability**: Sessions are short-lived and you’re using existing identity flows — easier to track and harder to misuse.

### How to Get Started — Step-by-Step

1. Install or upgrade your AWS CLI to **version 2.32.0** or later.
    
2. In your terminal, run:
    
    ```bash
    aws login
    ```
    
    If using multiple profiles:
    
    ```bash
    aws login --profile my-dev
    ```
    
3. A browser window opens — sign in with your IAM user or federated session as usual.
    
4. Once logged in, you are back in the terminal. Use CLI commands like:
    
    ```bash
    aws sts get-caller-identity
    ```
    
    to verify your session.
    
5. The CLI caches your session and auto-rotates the credentials. When session expires (max ~12 hours), run `aws login` again.
    
6. (Optional) Update your SDK-based tools to rely on the new credential provider so you can use the same login flow for code.

### Things to Watch / Tips

* Ensure your IAM user or role has the required actions: `signin:AuthorizeOAuth2Access` and `signin:CreateOAuth2Token`.
    
* If you manage many accounts via AWS IAM Identity Center or federated login, this still works — you’ll be prompted for your federated sign-in flow.
    
* If you’re using older SDKs that don’t yet support the new console-credentials provider, fallback to using `credential_process` pointing to `aws login`.
    
* Because these credentials are short-lived and browser-based, this flow is ideal for **interactive development**. For automated CI/CD pipelines, standard role-assume or IAM role methods remain important.

## TL;DR

You can now **use the same AWS console login** to generate programmatic credentials via `aws login`. No more managing long-term access keys — faster, simpler, and safer.
