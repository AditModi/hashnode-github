      "inputs": {
        "runCommand": ["sh", "configure_instances.sh"],
        "workingDirectory": "/tmp"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

* Shell Script (`configure_`[`instances.sh`](http://instances.sh)):
    

```plaintext
bashCopy code
#!/bin/bash
```

```plaintext
# Example: Configure Nginx on EC2 instances
sudo yum update -y
sudo yum install -y nginx
```

```plaintext
# Add custom configurations
echo "server {
  listen 80;
  server_name example.com;
```

```plaintext
  location / {
    root   /usr/share/nginx/html;
    index  index.html;
  }
}" | sudo tee /etc/nginx/conf.d/sample_app.conf
```

```plaintext
# Restart Nginx
sudo service nginx restart
```

**Apply Configurations at Scale:** Apply these configurations to multiple instances simultaneously.

* Execute the automation workflow for all instances:
    

```plaintext
bashCopy code
aws ssm start-automation-execution --document-name "configurations-automation-document" --region us-east-1
```

1. **Ensure Consistency:** Systems Manager ensures each instance receives the correct configurations consistently.
    
2. **Real-time Monitoring:** Benefit from real-time monitoring within Systems Manager, ensuring configurations are maintained.
    

**Use Case 2: Patch Management**

**Scenario:** Ensuring all your EC2 instances are up-to-date with the latest security patches is crucial for security and compliance.

**Solution:**

    {
      "action": "aws:runPatchBaseline",
      "name": "applyPatches",
      "inputs": {
        "installOverrideList": ["*"],
        "installOverride": "all",
        "rebootOption": "rebootIfNeeded"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Generate Compliance Reports:** Systems Manager generates compliance reports, showing the status of patching across instances.

* Run compliance checks:
    

```plaintext
bashCopy code
aws ssm list-compliance-items --resource-id "i-instanceID" --resource-type "ManagedInstance" --region us-east-1
```

1. **Scheduled Patching:** Set up scheduled patching windows to minimize disruption.
