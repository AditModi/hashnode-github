## How did I prepare ?

I spend a considerable amount of time learning AWS before attempting to take the Certification Exam. It is important that you spend time with AWS for you to be good at it. The Resources I used while preparing I am linking them below one by one.

1) **üìö Courses I took:** Initially, I enrolled in a course called ‚ÄúCertified SAP on AWS - Specialty (PAS-C01) Certification Preparation for AWS‚Äù by Cloud Academy which is a very good course and covers all the most important aspects of the AWS and the fundamentals of SAP and it is a very good start towards the certification. 

üëâ More Information on the course can be found [here](https://cloudacademy.com/learning-paths/certified-sap-on-aws-specialty-pas-c01-certification-preparation-for-aws-1-5729/)

2)**üõ†Ô∏è hands-on projects:** Learning only theory won't help , you must work on some hands-on AWS projects. I would recommend you to practice some of the AWS projects from [here](https://awsworkshop.io/) or you can practice them from [skills builder learning Center](https://skillbuilder.aws/).

üëâsome of the projects I practiced are mentioned in my [github repository](https://github.com/AditModi).

3)**üìã AWS Ramp-Up Guides:** Your guides to learning the AWS Cloud.

- AWS Ramp-Up Guides offer a variety of resources to help you build your skills and knowledge of the AWS Cloud. Each guide features carefully selected digital training, classroom courses, videos, whitepapers, certifications, and more. Explore the guides below by role, solution, or industry area.

üëâ more details can be found [here](https://aws.amazon.com/training/ramp-up-guides/)

4) **ü§ù being part of a Study Groups:** I also recommend you to be part of a study groups. it helps you stay focused, probably having study groups with people studying for the same exam is an added benefit.

Study Groups I was part of:

- Cloud and DevOps Babies:

Cloud and DevOps Babies are a global group of babies with curious minds to learn/decode Cloud, DevOps and Microservices tech stacks. 

üëâ more details can be found [here](https://www.linkedin.com/company/devopsandcloudbabies/)

- Tech Study Slack: 
TechStudySlack is a Slack for people studying Tech

üëâ more details can be found [here](https://techstudyslack.com/)

5)**‚úçÔ∏è practice tests:** Lastly I recommend all of you to pass these practice exams before attending the real exam. It provides simulated questions that are very similar to the actual exam.

One of the selling points of this practice exam is that each question contains detailed explanations that will help you gain a deeper understanding of AWS services. It not just explains what the correct answer is, but also explains why other answers are wrong. It is extremely helpful to make you recognize the difference between similar services.

- Tutorials Dojo Practice Exams:

üëâ more details can be found [here](https://tutorialsdojo.com/)

6)**üìù Notes:** I outlined the resources I would use and a rough guideline of how I would approach studying. You should find something that works for you but have structure and commit to it. 

## Useful Study tips and tricks

As usual, more study tips and tricks to help you with the exam:

- This exam is available through online proctoring so that you don‚Äôt have to travel to the nearby testing center to take this exam.
- Additional handicap of 30 minutes for non-native English speakers is still available, so make sure that you have requested that.
- Make sure you will use the flagging mechanism and reiterate the questions if you have time.
- There is no penalty for guessing.
- You can and should apply the same rules as in the other exams look [here]() for more details regarding how to read a question and answers.
