### Introduction

Much like AWS re:Invent's **attendee guides**—crafted by AWS Heroes, partners, and others to help attendees navigate the vast array of sessions—I wanted to create a personal guide for the sessions I am most excited about. If your interests align with mine in areas such as AWS, DevOps, AI/ML, and FinOps, you might find this curated list helpful too!

This is not just a guide for me but also for those who share similar passions. It highlights sessions that I believe will add immense value and practical insights. Whether you're attending in person or following online, this guide aims to help you make the most of your experience.  
  
**A Quick Note on Session Levels**

I’ve taken advice to heart:

* For topics I’m familiar with, I’ll attend 300/400-level sessions.
    
* For topics I’m less knowledgeable about, I’ll stick to 200-level sessions for foundational learning.
    

Let’s dive into the sessions that caught my attention.

### Closing Comments

I hope this guide serves as a helpful resource for planning your time at re:Invent 2024. If you’re attending in person, I strongly recommend prioritizing **workshops** and **chalk talks**, as they often provide insights that are not available online.

Remember to wear comfortable shoes, stay hydrated, and take time to network—it’s often during hallway conversations that the best ideas spark. And don’t forget to enjoy the social events; they’re a fantastic way to unwind and connect with like-minded professionals.

Let me know which sessions you’re excited about.

**Happy learning!**
