1) Data is collected from multiple data sources across the enterprise, software as a service (SaaS) applications, edge devices, logs, streaming data, and social media networks.

2) Based on the type of data source, AWS Database Migration Service, AWS DataSync, Amazon Kinesis, Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka, AWS IoT Core, AWS Glue and Amazon
AppFlow are used to ingest the data into the data lake in AWS.

3) Amazon S3 is used for fully managed, highly available and scalable data lake storage.

4) AWS Glue is used to extract, transform and ingest data across multiple data stores. Amazon EMR provides the cloud big data platform for processing vast amounts of data using open source analytics framework. AWS Lambda and Amazon EC2 provide compute capability for data enrichment needs.

5) Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (MWAA ) or AWS Step Functions is used for orchestrating end-to-end data pipelines.

6) AWS Lake Formation makes it easy to build, secure and manage your data lake, providing single place to enforce data classification and manage fine-grained access. AWS IAM and AWS STS provides ability to manage access permissions and temporary credentials.

7) Snowflake is used as virtual data warehouse with ability to query Amazon S3 using external tables, and automated and continuous data ingestion using SnowPipe.

8) Amazon SageMaker can be used to build, train, and deploy machine learning (ML) models, and add intelligence to your Applications. Amazon QuickSight provides ML-powered business intelligence (BI).
