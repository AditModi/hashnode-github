Just wrapped up three incredible days at **HashiConf 2025** in San Francisco ‚Äî and like every good community experience, I left with a full notebook, a ton of ideas, and a deeper sense of belonging.

This wasn‚Äôt my first HashiCorp event, but it was the first time I was able to experience so much *in person* ‚Äî after years of being part of the community virtually. And that alone made this trip feel really special.

Here‚Äôs a look at some of the moments that stuck with me.

### Pre-Event Vibes: Arcade Bars, Tech Talk & Long-Overdue Meetups

Things kicked off with a bang at the **HashiCorp User Group (HUG) Meetup** at *Emporium Arcade Bar*. Picture a room full of practitioners, arcade machines glowing, and conversations bouncing between console classics and infrastructure trends.

It was great to finally meet **Michael Aldridge**, fellow Ambassador and Nomad champion ‚Äî I‚Äôve followed his work for a while, and picking his brain on where the tech is headed (especially around Nomad) was one of those chats that leaves you thinking long after it‚Äôs over.

I also finally met **Alexandra**, **Jasmine**, and **Melissa** ‚Äî people I‚Äôve known online for years through the HashiCorp community. Getting to meet them in person felt like finally closing the loop on a long-running async conversation.

Of course, it wasn‚Äôt just new faces ‚Äî I caught up with old friends like **Vishnu** and **Ritesh**, and met folks I‚Äôd only seen in virtual events: **Nasiullha**, **Saravanan**, **Mahendra**, **Dheeraj**, **Vishal**, **Rahul**‚Ä¶ the list goes on. (And no, I‚Äôm not going to try and tag everyone ‚Äî that always ends with someone feeling left out üòÖ)

### Product Day: Honest Feedback, Big Ideas, and Community That Speaks Up

Product Day was held at **HashiCorp HQ**, and I think this is where it really hit me how deeply Ambassadors care about the tools and ecosystem. The day was structured into focused feedback sessions ‚Äî and we were divided into smaller teams for deeper discussions. I ended up with **Saravanan**, **Mahendra**, **Takayoshi**, and **YB**, and honestly, it was impressive to see how direct and thoughtful everyone was.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1759566995508/1b1d184f-b262-4263-8419-da9135c3e83a.jpeg align="center")

No sugar-coating. No fluff. Just real feedback, aimed at making things better ‚Äî and that‚Äôs what makes this community unique. We weren‚Äôt there to be polite; we were there to be useful.

We covered everything from Vault, Boundary, and Terraform to broader conversations around integrations and future direction. The HashiCorp product and engineering teams showed up, listened, and engaged ‚Äî and that kind of direct loop between practitioners and builders is rare.

### A Little Detour: AWS x HashiCorp Gameday üïπÔ∏è

Before the evening reception, **Saravanan** and I made a quick detour to the **AWS x HashiCorp Gameday** ‚Äî a fun (and surprisingly chill) competition led by **Chris** and **Welly**. The challenge was cool, though I‚Äôll admit I found it a bit too easy üòÑ ‚Äî but still had a blast. Saravanan even came second and walked away with a brand-new keyboard!

### Evening Reception: Stories, Prints, and the Ice Cream Club

The evening reception at **Fort Mason** was amazing ‚Äî the venue, the people, the energy. We got these limited edition HashiCorp prints that we could stamp on our t-shirts (yes, I did it, and yes, it was cool). There were also sneak peeks into the **Escape Room** hosted by **Chris**, and **Robo Rally** by **Kerim** ‚Äî which everyone was buzzing about.

I also got to meet a few AWS folks ‚Äî **Welly**, **Sourav Kondu**, **Manu Chandrashekar**, and **Saurav Mishra**, another virtual connection finally made real.

But more than anything, it was just‚Ä¶ fun. The kind of fun that reminds you how much shared passion and play matter in building strong communities.

### HashiConf Day 1: Reserved Seats, Real Talks & My Session

As Ambassadors, we got reserved seating for the keynotes ‚Äî front and center. Watching **Armon** take the stage live was a moment in itself. The energy in the room was electric, and the announcements (which I‚Äôll talk about in another post) set the tone for what‚Äôs next.

Later in the day, I gave a hallway track session titled:  
**‚ÄúRAG meets reality: Building secure, compliant GenAI with Vault and Bedrock.‚Äù**  
It was great to see people curious about the topic, and the hallway track format made it super interactive ‚Äî lots of good conversations, questions, and follow-ups.

There was also a "Meet the Ambassador" segment that I really liked ‚Äî it gave attendees a chance to casually connect, ask questions, and hear different stories from folks across the program.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1759567473744/f8606f97-8195-4182-b34b-eec1bc5d31ab.jpeg align="center")

Before the main reception, we had a special Ambassador-only gathering where I got to meet **Armon** (yes, photo incoming üòÑ) and connect with an incredible group: **Amaury**, **Diego**, **Carla**, **Leo**, **Mark**, **Bryan**, and so many others. The conversations were honest, thoughtful, and full of that unmistakable builder energy.

The main reception was probably one of the best parts of the entire event. I ended up deep in conversation with **Majjis** about his book, and then listening to **Ritesh** share his thoughts on building platforms. At one point, **Alexandra** joined us, and somehow we all discovered we share a serious love for ice cream ‚Äî small things like that just stick.

We even ended the night with a fun game: **India vs Korea** ‚Äî not tech, just for fun. Sadly, India lost, but it was worth it for the laughs alone.

### HashiConf Day 2: Mitchell, Memories, and Milestones

Day two opened with another powerful keynote ‚Äî but what made it extra special was seeing **Mitchell Hashimoto** back on stage. That moment felt like a nod to the roots of everything HashiCorp has built over the last decade.

Later in the day, I had one of the most insightful conversations of the trip ‚Äî a deep dive with **Welly** from AWS. We ended up talking about **AWS, AI, and Agentic Systems**, and honestly, I walked away with some fresh perspectives and actionable takeaways. It‚Äôs the kind of exchange that sticks with you ‚Äî thoughtful, honest, and full of those ‚Äúyou know what, that makes sense‚Äù moments. (And of course, if you know me, you know I talk, walk, and sleep AWS ‚Äî so this felt right at home.)

I also made it a point to attend several sessions from fellow Ambassadors and community folks ‚Äî talks by **Mahinder**, **Vishnu**, **Welly**, **Sourav**, **Manu**, and others. It was genuinely inspiring to see the variety of topics, perspectives, and the depth of work everyone is doing in their own ecosystems. There‚Äôs a different kind of connection when you‚Äôre in the audience rooting for people you know and respect.

There was a small corner at the venue displaying **swag and photos from the past 10 years of HashiConf**, and it really made me pause. Ten years of builders, learnings, tools, growth. It felt like being part of something that‚Äôs not just evolving ‚Äî but maturing in the right ways.

### Closing Thoughts

HashiConf 2025 wasn‚Äôt just about announcements or sessions ‚Äî it was about conversations, shared experiences, and a community that genuinely wants to make things better. Whether it was feedback during Product Day, arcade banter at the HUG meetup, or deep conversations over food and keynotes ‚Äî it all felt real.

If you‚Äôve ever thought about getting involved with the HashiCorp community, I‚Äôd say: jump in. There‚Äôs space for curiosity, for questions, for ideas ‚Äî and for people who care.

Until next time, SF üëãüèΩ
