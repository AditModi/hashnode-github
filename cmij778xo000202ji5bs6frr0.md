I remember the day clearly. After returning from KubeCon in 2022, I was curious about local AWS activity and decided to search for user groups near me. I found a meetup listed for Vadodara and went — not as a speaker, not as an organiser, simply as someone who wanted to learn.

Walking into that room for the first time was a small shock. People were talking architecture, deployments, and product announcements like it was just another day. I felt out of place for a moment. Then Manan Vasavada — hosting the meetup at Avdevs — said something simple and disarming:

> “No one here is an expert. You have a topic? Just talk about it.”

That sentence changed everything. It removed the need to be perfect. It made space for people who were curious and willing to share. I kept coming back.

## The Beginning: That First Meetup (June 2022)

My first AWS User Group Vadodara meetup (June 2022) wasn’t flashy. There were chairs, a projector, people with laptops, and tea. What stood out was how welcoming everyone was.

That first month I asked questions, stayed late, and quietly watched how things ran. The next month, I arrived earlier. The month after, I stayed later. It was small steps — but they added up.

---

## Showing Up, Month After Month

**Consistency is underrated.** For nearly three years, I didn’t miss a single monthly meetup. I started showing up on time every month. Small habits matter: arriving early to set up, checking the projector, greeting newcomers, and helping the speaker when they needed a mic or a laptop connection. Those tiny acts made the meetings smoother and made new people feel welcome.

I also started documenting the meetups — posting pre-event reminders, speaker bios, and after-event summaries on social media. That visibility made a difference. More people showed up simply because they saw what was happening and felt it was for them.

Being present wasn’t glamorous. It meant weekends, late nights, logistics, and sometimes juggling this with work and life. But I liked it. It felt like I was building something that mattered.

---

## The First Time I Spoke

The first time I accepted an invite to speak, I was terrified. I wasn’t a polished presenter. I had no illusions about being perfect. I had something practical to say about AWS certifications and learning paths — things that had helped me and others. I shared what worked, what didn’t, and practical next steps.

After the session, people came up and thanked me. A few folks messaged later that week saying they felt inspired to try certifications or to prepare a talk. That response made it clear: leadership in community often starts from sharing what you know — not from waiting until you feel ready.

---

## Building the Social Presence & Growing the Room

One of the things I took on early was the group’s social presence. Posting event details, photos, and highlights made the group visible beyond the same faces. It helped reach students, developers, and people who otherwise wouldn’t have known a local group existed.

I wrote the pre-event posts, live updates, and post-event recaps. I encouraged attendees to post their takeaways and tag us. That simple, consistent outreach turned one-off attendees into regulars and made the community feel bigger than the meetup room.

---

## Becoming One of the People Who Makes Things Happen

My shift from attendee to leader wasn’t sudden — it was built one small contribution at a time. Arriving early. Staying late. Troubleshooting issues. Guiding first-timers to their seats. Calling speakers to ensure they reached safely. It was never glamorous — but it mattered. And right alongside me was **Jay** — the quiet architect of every successful Community Day in Vadodara. The person who could find a venue when every option seemed impossible, who would rush across the city to pick up banners and badges that arrived an hour too late, who would test every mic thrice because “once” is never enough, who made sure the food actually arrived before lunch break, and who held the team together when stress could have easily pulled us apart. The audience sees speakers, lights, and applause — but the real story lives in the hands that carry banners at 11 PM and the brains juggling 50 problems no one will ever hear about. That’s when I understood: leadership isn’t being recognized — it’s making sure everyone else can shine.

## Community Days and Themed Events — Going Bigger, Together

What started as monthly meetups turned into something larger. Over the years we organized major events that brought the community together in bigger ways:

* [**AWS Community Day Vadodara 2022** — the first big push](https://aditmodi.hashnode.dev/series/community)
    
* [**AWS Community Day Vadodara 2023** — bigger stage, more tracks](https://aditmodi.hashnode.dev/series/community)
    
* [**AWS Community Day Vadodara 2024** — polishing processes, increasing reach](https://aditmodi.hashnode.dev/my-experience-at-aws-community-day-vadodara-2024)
    
* [**AWS Community Day Vadodara 2025** — refining and scaling what we built](https://aditmodi.hashnode.dev/series/community)
    

Alongside these, we ran focused tech events:

* [**AI/ML event (2023)**](https://aditmodi.hashnode.dev/series/community)
    
* [**GenAI event (2024)**](https://aditmodi.hashnode.dev/series/community)
    
* [**GenAI event (2025)**](https://aditmodi.hashnode.dev/series/community)
    

We were fortunate to host international speakers — people like **Mike, Sebastian, Tiffany** — who joined sessions, shared global perspectives, and inspired local builders. Their presence amplified what Vadodara could offer and showed attendees that local stages can host global conversations.

Organizing these larger events involved months of planning, sponsor coordination, speaker management, and countless micro-decisions. These are not one-person jobs. They require a small army of volunteers, late-night Slack threads, and a lot of patience.

## The Real Struggles: Burnout and Quiet Failures

I want to be honest: community work is not always uplifting. There are real struggles.

There were meetups where only a handful of people came. I’ve felt the fatigue of endless planning, the quiet sting when a speaker cancels last minute, and the slow ache of balancing community work with life.

I’ve questioned whether I should keep doing this. I’ve asked myself whether anyone noticed the effort.

But then someone tells me they started learning because of our event, or they landed a job after a demo they saw at a meetup. Those moments remind me why the messy, imperfect work matters.

## Stepping Aside So Others Can Rise

One of the most important lessons I’ve learned is to know when to step back. This year, at Community Day Vadodara 2025, I chose not to take the stage. It wasn’t because I had nothing to say — far from it. It was because the community has new voices who need the spotlight more. Letting newer builders speak, present their projects, and own the stage is the point of doing this work.

Leadership in community is not about accumulating speaking slots or trophies. It’s about making room for others.

## Why Lead a User Group? Why Give Time When There Are No Official Perks?

This question comes up a lot. User groups don’t hand out titles or salaries. So why commit?

Because the value is in the change you create — in others and in yourself:

* You build real leadership skills by doing practical work.
    
* You accelerate learning — teaching is the fastest way to learn.
    
* You create networks that open unexpected doors.
    
* You help people take the first step toward a new career or a new confidence.
    
* You shape a local ecosystem that didn’t exist before.
    

Those are the benefits that matter. They’re not flashy, but they last.

## The People — Always the Heart of This Story

This whole story is about people. Nirmal, Nilesh, Dimple, Manan, Jay, Dhaval, Ravi, Vrajesh, Chirag, Priyal, Harshal, Abhilasha, Vikramaditya — and many more — built the community by showing up, again and again. The community is the sum of a thousand small acts: a message of encouragement, a hand moving chairs, a slide deck prepped the night before.

If you’re reading this and thinking the community worked because of a name on a poster — that’s only half true. The real credit belongs to the people who quietly do the work.

## What’s Next — A Small Call to Action and a Future Note

Vadodara is growing. New faces come each month. We’re building processes that can scale. I want the user group to become a place where anyone — student, developer, entrepreneur — can learn, teach, and find collaborators.

If you’re curious, come to one meetup. If you’re nervous about speaking, start with a five-minute lightning talk. If you want to help but think you’re not “qualified,” show up with a willingness to set up chairs, hand out badges, or run a social post. Those small acts change everything.

My hope for the future is simple: more first-timers trying their first talk, more people mentoring newcomers, and more ideas turned into projects. I will keep hosting diverse events — from AI/ML to GenAI to hands-on workshops — and continue to invite global voices to local stages.

## Final Thought

I started attending a meetup in June 2022 not knowing where it would lead. Today I find myself part of a community that has given opportunities, friendships, skills, and a platform to many people who would otherwise never have had one.

This story is not about me. It’s about what happens when people show up for each other. If you want to be part of something real — not for the swag or the title, but for the messy, rewarding work of building — join us at the next AWS User Group Vadodara meetup. Come curious. Bring patience. Leave willing to help.

That’s how communities grow.
