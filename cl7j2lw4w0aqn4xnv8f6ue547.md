1) Data is collected from multiple data sources across the enterprise, SaaS applications, edge
devices, logs, streaming media, and social networks.

2) Based on the type of the data source, AWS Database Migration Service, AWS DataSync, Amazon Kinesis, Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka, AWS IoT Core, and Amazon AppFlow are used to ingest the data into a Data Lake in AWS.

3) AWS Data Exchange is used for integrating third-party data into the Data Lake. 

4) AWS Lake Formation is used to build the scalable data lake, and Amazon S3 is used as
the data lake storage.

5) AWS Lake Formation is also used to enable unified governance to centrally manage the
security, access control, and audit trails.

6) AWS Glue and AWS Glue DataBrew are used to catalog, transform, enrich, move, and replicate
data across multiple data stores and the data lake.

7) Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics is used to transform and analyze streaming data in real
time.

8) Amazon QuickSight provides machine learning-powered business intelligence.

9) Amazon SageMaker and AWS AI services can be used to build, train and deploy
machine learning models, and add intelligence to your applications.

10) Amazon Redshift is used as a Cloud Data Warehouse.
11) Amazon EMR provides the cloud big data platform for processing vast amounts of data
using open source tools.

12) Amazon SageMaker and AWS AI services can be used to build, train and deploy
machine learning models, and add intelligence to your applications.

13) Amazon Redshift Spectrum and Amazon Athena enable interactive querying,
analyzing, and processing capabilities.
