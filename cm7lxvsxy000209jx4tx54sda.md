When developing and deploying applications on AWS, one of the key decisions you’ll make is how to host your application and which compute service to use. AWS provides three primary services for running applications in the cloud: **Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**, **Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service)**, and **Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)**. While all three services can be used to deploy applications, they each serve different purposes and use cases.

In this blog post, we will compare **Amazon EC2**, **Amazon ECS**, and **Amazon EKS** in terms of functionality, use cases, pricing, and management complexity to help you choose the best service for your workloads.

### **What is Amazon EC2?**

**Amazon EC2** (Elastic Compute Cloud) is the most fundamental and flexible compute service offered by AWS. It allows you to rent virtual machines (VMs), called **instances**, in the cloud. With EC2, you have full control over the operating system, installed software, and configurations of your instance. EC2 instances are highly customizable, and you can select the type, size, and region of your instance.

#### **Key Features of EC2**:

* **Full control**: You manage everything, including OS, software, scaling, and networking.
    
* **Flexible instance types**: You can choose from a wide variety of instance types (e.g., compute, memory, storage optimized) based on your workload requirements.
    
* **Auto Scaling**: Automatically scale the number of instances based on demand using **Auto Scaling groups**.
    
* **Security and networking**: Integrates with **VPC**, **Security Groups**, and **IAM** for controlling access and networking.
    

#### **Use Cases for EC2**:

* **Traditional Applications**: When you need full control over the infrastructure and need to manage the entire stack, EC2 is the best option.
    
* **Custom Software**: If your application requires specific software configurations, custom libraries, or specialized operating systems, EC2 provides the flexibility you need.
    
* **Legacy Applications**: If you have legacy applications that require specific server configurations and operating systems, EC2 is ideal.
    

#### **Pricing**:

* You pay for the instance type you select, based on **on-demand**, **reserved**, or **spot** pricing models.
    
* Additional costs apply for **EBS storage**, **data transfer**, and **Elastic IPs**.
    

### **What is Amazon ECS?**

**Amazon ECS** (Elastic Container Service) is a fully managed service that allows you to run and manage Docker containers at scale. ECS abstracts away much of the complexity of managing containerized applications and enables you to launch, manage, and scale Docker containers in a highly available and secure environment. ECS can run containers on EC2 instances or with **AWS Fargate**, a serverless compute engine for containers.

#### **Key Features of ECS**:

* **Managed Container Orchestration**: ECS automates the scheduling, deployment, and scaling of containers.
    
* **Integration with AWS Services**: ECS integrates seamlessly with other AWS services like **ALB (Application Load Balancer)**, **CloudWatch**, **IAM**, **Secrets Manager**, and **RDS**.
    
* **Supports Docker**: ECS uses Docker as its containerization standard, allowing you to deploy applications packaged as Docker images.
    
* **Two Launch Types**:
    
    * **EC2 Launch Type**: You manage the EC2 instances on which your containers run.
        
    * **Fargate Launch Type**: AWS manages the underlying infrastructure, and you focus on the containers themselves.
        

#### **Use Cases for ECS**:

* **Microservices**: ECS is ideal for applications based on a microservices architecture, where different services run in separate containers.
    
* **Batch Jobs**: ECS is great for managing containerized batch jobs that require auto-scaling and load balancing.
    
* **Web Applications**: When you need to run a containerized web application with automatic scaling and load balancing, ECS is a suitable choice.
    

#### **Pricing**:

* **ECS with EC2 Launch Type**: You pay for the EC2 instances that run your containers (same as EC2 pricing).
    
* **ECS with Fargate**: You pay for the compute resources (CPU and memory) that your containers use, on a per-second basis.
    

### **What is Amazon EKS?**

**Amazon EKS** (Elastic Kubernetes Service) is a managed service that simplifies the process of running **Kubernetes** clusters in AWS. Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. EKS provides a fully managed Kubernetes control plane, eliminating the need to manually manage the complexities of Kubernetes.

#### **Key Features of EKS**:

* **Managed Kubernetes**: AWS manages the Kubernetes control plane (masters), including patching and upgrades.
    
* **Integration with AWS Services**: EKS integrates with **IAM**, **VPC**, **CloudWatch**, **ALB**, and other AWS services.
    
* **Container Orchestration**: Like ECS, EKS automates deployment and scaling of containers, but it uses Kubernetes as the orchestration engine.
    
* **High Availability**: EKS automatically provisions multi-AZ (Availability Zone) clusters for high availability.
    
* **Support for Hybrid Applications**: EKS allows you to integrate your on-premises Kubernetes clusters with those running on AWS.
    

#### **Use Cases for EKS**:

* **Kubernetes-based Applications**: If you already use Kubernetes or plan to use Kubernetes for container orchestration, EKS is the right choice.
    
* **Multi-Cloud or Hybrid Environments**: EKS allows you to run a Kubernetes cluster across different cloud environments or even on-premises.
    
* **Large-Scale Deployments**: EKS is ideal for large-scale containerized applications that require sophisticated scheduling, monitoring, and management features that Kubernetes offers.
    

#### **Pricing**:

* **EKS Control Plane**: You pay a fixed hourly fee for each Kubernetes cluster control plane you create.
    
* **Worker Nodes**: You pay for the EC2 instances (or Fargate) used to run the worker nodes in your Kubernetes cluster.
    

### **Comparison: EC2 vs. ECS vs. EKS**

| Feature | **Amazon EC2** | **Amazon ECS** | **Amazon EKS** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Type** | Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) | Container orchestration service | Managed Kubernetes service |
