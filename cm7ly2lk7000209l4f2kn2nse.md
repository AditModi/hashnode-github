When managing sensitive data, such as API keys, database credentials, and application configuration, it is crucial to ensure that such data is securely stored, accessed, and managed. AWS provides two services to help with managing this type of information: **AWS Secrets Manager** and **AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store**.

While both services are designed to securely store and manage sensitive data, they each have unique features, use cases, and pricing models. In this blog post, we'll compare **AWS Secrets Manager** and **AWS Parameter Store** to help you determine which service best suits your needs for managing configuration data and secrets in your AWS environment.

### **What is AWS Secrets Manager?**

**AWS Secrets Manager** is a fully managed service that enables you to securely store, manage, and retrieve sensitive information such as API keys, passwords, database credentials, and other secrets. Secrets Manager is designed specifically for use cases where the management of secrets and credentials is critical, including automatic rotation of secrets, secure access, and detailed auditing.

#### **Key Features of AWS Secrets Manager:**

* **Secret Rotation**: AWS Secrets Manager provides native support for rotating secrets automatically. You can configure Secrets Manager to automatically rotate credentials for supported AWS services like RDS and Redshift, or create custom rotation strategies.
    
* **Fine-Grained Access Control**: Integrated with **AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)**, you can set up fine-grained permissions for who can access secrets, offering a high level of control.
    
* **Auditability**: AWS Secrets Manager integrates with AWS CloudTrail, allowing you to track access and modifications to your secrets for auditing purposes.
    
* **Encryption**: Secrets stored in AWS Secrets Manager are encrypted at rest using AWS KMS (Key Management Service), ensuring that your secrets are always protected.
    
* **Secure Integration with AWS Services**: Secrets Manager integrates with a wide variety of AWS services, such as Amazon RDS, Amazon ECS, and Amazon Lambda, for securely managing application secrets.
    
* **Versioning**: AWS Secrets Manager maintains versioning of secrets, so you can easily roll back to previous versions when necessary.
    

#### **Use Cases for AWS Secrets Manager:**

* **Database Credentials Management**: Managing database credentials securely for applications such as RDS, Aurora, or Redshift.
    
* **API Key Management**: Storing and rotating API keys used for third-party integrations.
    
* **Application Secrets**: Storing secrets such as OAuth tokens, private keys, or SSL certificates used within your application.
    
* **Automated Secret Rotation**: Automatically rotating credentials and keys to improve security and reduce the risk of compromise.
    

#### **Pricing:**

AWS Secrets Manager pricing is based on the number of secrets stored and the number of API calls made to retrieve those secrets. There is an additional cost for secret rotation. AWS provides a free tier for Secrets Manager, which allows for 30 secrets per month and up to 10,000 API calls.

### **What is AWS Parameter Store?**

**AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store** is a fully managed service that enables you to store configuration data and sensitive information, such as passwords, license keys, or configuration settings, securely. Parameter Store is part of **AWS Systems Manager**, a suite of tools for managing and automating operations in AWS.

#### **Key Features of AWS Parameter Store:**

* **Hierarchical Storage**: Parameters are stored hierarchically, allowing you to organize your configuration data in a structured way.
    
* **Simple Secrets Management**: While Parameter Store can store sensitive information, it lacks some advanced features (like automatic secret rotation) that are available in Secrets Manager. However, it still encrypts data using AWS KMS.
    
* **Secure and Controlled Access**: Using **AWS IAM**, you can control access to specific parameters at a granular level, ensuring that only authorized users or services can retrieve or modify the stored values.
    
* **Integration with AWS Services**: Parameter Store can be integrated with services like EC2, Lambda, and CloudFormation to retrieve configuration data for your applications.
    
* **Version Control**: Similar to Secrets Manager, Parameter Store supports versioning, so you can track changes and roll back to previous versions of your parameters.
    
* **Standard and Advanced Parameters**: Parameter Store provides both **Standard Parameters** (free tier) and **Advanced Parameters**. Advanced Parameters offer higher storage limits, and are typically used for larger or more sensitive data (e.g., long strings or larger binary data).
    
* **Auditability**: Parameters are logged in **AWS CloudTrail**, so you can track access, modification, and changes to your stored values for security and compliance purposes.
    

#### **Use Cases for AWS Parameter Store:**

* **Storing Configuration Data**: Ideal for storing non-sensitive data like application configuration settings, environment variables, and other parameters that can be accessed by your AWS infrastructure.
    
* **Secret Storage for Lower Risk Data**: Suitable for storing less sensitive secrets that don’t require automatic rotation, such as certain API keys or application credentials.
    
* **Integration with Systems Manager**: If you're already using **AWS Systems Manager** for other operational tasks, Parameter Store is an ideal option for integrating with other services, like EC2 or Lambda, to retrieve configuration values.
    

#### **Pricing:**

AWS Parameter Store is generally more cost-effective for storing configuration data. The pricing is based on the type of parameters (Standard vs. Advanced), the number of API requests, and the storage used. Standard Parameters are free within limits, but Advanced Parameters incur additional charges.
