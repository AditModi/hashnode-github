Imagine your AWS account is like a garage full of tools and equipment. Over time, some tools (EBS volumes) get left behind, and others are outdated models. You want a way to *automatically clean up unused tools* and *upgrade to better ones*, without doing it manually every month.

That’s exactly what **Compute Optimizer Automation Rules** now lets you do for EBS:

### What’s New — and Why It Helps

* You can **automatically apply optimization recommendations** from Compute Optimizer on a schedule (daily / weekly / monthly).
    
* Easily define rules based on:
    
    * **AWS Region** (optimize only in specific geographies)
        
    * **Resource Tags** (like distinguishing dev vs prod)
        
    * Other criteria like current volume type, size, or estimated savings.
        
* Supported **actions** include:
    
    * Deleting **unattached EBS volumes** (after snapshotting them), and
        
    * **Upgrading** older-volume types (for example, moving from gp2 → gp3) to newer, more efficient types.
        
* There’s a **dashboard** in Compute Optimizer where you can:
    
    * See a history of automation rule events,
        
    * Track how many actions ran,
        
    * Estimate the savings you achieved, and
        
    * **Rollback** actions if needed.
        
* You can create **organization-wide rules** (if you're using AWS Organizations). That means your management account can apply optimizations across all member accounts, or you can apply rules on a per-account basis.

### How to Use This — Step by Step

1. Go to **Compute Optimizer Console → Automation → Create Rule**.
    
2. Choose whether it's an **Account Rule** or an **Organization Rule**.
    
3. Select which **recommendation types** you want to automate (e.g., delete unattached volumes, upgrade volume type).
    
4. Define **criteria**: Set filters like region, volume size, tags, etc., so the rule only applies where you want.
    
5. Configure a **schedule** (daily / weekly / monthly), and define your time window (start time, end time).
    
6. Save and **activate** the rule. You can also preview matching recommendations before applying, to avoid surprises.
    
7. **Monitor and manage**: Use the Automation dashboard to monitor events, check savings, and undo actions if needed.

### Why You Should Care (Real-World Impact)

* **Reduce AWS Cost Without Manual Work**: Let Compute Optimizer clean up dead volumes and upgrade storage on your behalf.
    
* **Scale Optimization**: With organization-wide rules, you don’t have to manually manage EBS optimizations in every account — just define once.
    
* **Smarter Governance**: Use tags and regions to target only non-production or low-risk environments initially, then expand.
    
* **Safe Automation**: Every deletion creates a snapshot first, and upgrades are reversible. You maintain control + safety.

### Things to Watch / Trade-offs

* Automation is **only available in certain AWS Regions**.
    
* If your rule is too broad (e.g., “all unattached volumes”), you might snapshot and delete volumes you actually intended to keep. Use **criteria filters** wisely.
    
* Actions run on a schedule and are subject to **Compute Optimizer concurrency limits**.
    
* While you can roll back actions, snapshot restores or volume type changes may take time — plan for that in your incident or recovery strategy.

## TL;DR

With **Compute Optimizer Automation Rules**, you can schedule automatic cleanup and upgrading of EBS volumes based on smart recommendations — saving money *without writing a single script*. Set your rules, let it run, and reclaim your “garage.”
