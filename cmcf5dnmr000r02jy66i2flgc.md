### **2\. Building a Custom AI Workstation or Server Farm with NVIDIA A100 GPUs**

For organizations that require more flexibility and customization, building a **dedicated AI workstation** or **server farm** is an effective option. This allows for cost optimization while maintaining high-performance standards.

#### **Choosing the Right Hardware**

The foundation of a custom AI server farm lies in selecting the right hardware components. Below is an overview of how to assemble a high-performance AI infrastructure using **NVIDIA A100 GPUs**:

1. **NVIDIA A100 GPUs**: These GPUs are ideal for deep learning workloads due to their architecture, which offers **high throughput** and supports **multi-instance GPU (MIG)** capabilities. MIG enables the splitting of the A100 GPU into smaller instances, offering **flexibility** and **scalability**.
    
2. **CPU and Memory**: Pair the A100 with a high-performance **multi-core CPU** (e.g., AMD EPYC or Intel Xeon) and **large memory capacity** (256GB or more). This ensures that data is readily available to the GPUs, reducing any performance bottlenecks.
    
3. **Storage**: Depending on the size of your datasets, high-speed **NVMe SSDs** or **network-attached storage (NAS)** will be essential for quick data access and storage throughput during training.
    
4. **Networking**: To reduce latency and increase the throughput between your GPUs, **InfiniBand** or **10/25/40Gb Ethernet** is crucial. This allows GPUs to communicate with each other faster, especially during large-scale distributed training.
    

#### **Scalability and Redundancy**

As workloads grow, scalability becomes essential. Building **AI server farms** ensures that you can scale horizontally by adding more **GPU nodes** as required. Additionally, ensure that your system design includes **redundancy**—such as multiple power supplies and cooling systems—so that your AI infrastructure can remain operational in case of failure.

### **4\. Implementing a Scalable AI Workload Pipeline: A Technical Demo**

To better understand how to implement on-prem AI infrastructure, let’s walk through an example of setting up an AI pipeline for image classification using **TensorFlow** on **NVIDIA A100 GPUs**.

#### **Step 1: Setting Up the Environment**

First, we install the required software on the system:

* **NVIDIA drivers and CUDA**: To leverage GPU acceleration, ensure that the correct **CUDA version** is installed along with NVIDIA’s **GPU drivers**.
    

```bash
TensorFlow with GPU support: Install the GPU version of TensorFlow.        
```

* **TensorFlow with GPU support**: Install the GPU version of TensorFlow.
    

```bash
pip install tensorflow-gpu    
```

#### **Step 2: Prepare the Data Pipeline**

Next, we prepare our dataset for training. For example, let’s use the **CIFAR-10 dataset** for image classification.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import datasets

# Load CIFAR-10 dataset
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = datasets.cifar10.load_data()    
```

#### **Step 3: Define the Model**

Now, we define a simple **CNN model** for classification.

```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense

model = Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(32, 32, 3)),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])    
```

#### **Step 4: Compile and Train the Model**

Now, compile the model and begin training on the **NVIDIA A100 GPU**.

```python
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Training the model on A100 GPU
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=64, validation_data=(x_test, y_test))    
```

By leveraging the **NVIDIA A100**, the model can be trained at **significantly faster speeds**, reducing training times and increasing productivity.
