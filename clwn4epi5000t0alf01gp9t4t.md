Madhuri Susarla led a workshop on Amazon Q, showcasing its capabilities as a generative AI-powered assistant designed to accelerate software development and leverage internal data. This hands-on session provided a comprehensive overview of Amazon Q, including practical exercises that allowed us to explore its features such as automating routine tasks, generating code snippets, and identifying and fixing bugs. The workshop was highly interactive and informative, offering a unique perspective on how Amazon Q can transform development workflows and enhance productivity in real-world applications.

Chandrashekar's insights into resilience engineering were particularly relevant given the increasing complexity of modern cloud environments.  
  
**Lightning Talks by AWS Ambassadors**

In addition to the main sessions, the summit featured several lightning talks by AWS ambassadors. These quick, informative presentations covered a range of topics, from innovative use cases of AWS services to personal experiences and insights on navigating the cloud landscape.

The golden jacket symbolizes dedication, expertise, and significant contributions to the AWS community. Standing among such accomplished individuals was a proud moment, celebrating our collective achievements.

The ceremony also included special mentions for ambassadors who have gone above and beyond in their contributions. Hearing their stories of dedication, innovation, and community support was truly inspiring, reinforcing the impact we can have as AWS ambassadors.

The summit provided numerous opportunities to connect with fellow AWS ambassadors from across India. Networking sessions were designed to facilitate meaningful interactions, allowing us to share experiences, discuss challenges, and learn from each other. These conversations were invaluable, providing new perspectives and insights.

We explored potential collaborations and discussed how we can work together to amplify our impact. These discussions highlighted the importance of teamwork and community support in driving innovation.

#### **Informal Interactions**

In addition to the formal sessions and networking events, there were plenty of opportunities for informal interactions. Whether over a cup of coffee or during lunch breaks, these conversations often provided just as much value as the scheduled sessions. They allowed us to build deeper connections and discuss ideas in a more relaxed setting.

### **Exploring Bengaluru’s Culinary Scene**

#### **Dinner at Rameshwaram Cafe**

No trip to Bengaluru is complete without indulging in its vibrant culinary scene. After the intense sessions at the summit, I decided to unwind and explore some local flavors. One evening, I had dinner at Rameshwaram Cafe, a highly recommended spot for South Indian cuisine.

Rameshwaram Cafe is known for its authentic South Indian dishes, and it did not disappoint. The menu featured a wide variety of dosas, idlis, vadas, and other traditional items. I decided to try the masala dosa, a classic South Indian dish, and it was absolutely delicious. The dosa was perfectly crispy on the outside and filled with a flavorful potato masala. It was served with a variety of chutneys and sambar, each adding a unique flavor to the meal.

The ambience of the cafe was warm and inviting, with a casual and relaxed vibe. It was the perfect place to unwind after a busy day at the summit. The staff were friendly and attentive, making the dining experience even more enjoyable. If you’re ever in Bengaluru, I highly recommend visiting Rameshwaram Cafe for an authentic taste of South Indian cuisine.

In addition to Rameshwaram Cafe, I explored other local eateries and food joints. Bengaluru is known for its diverse culinary offerings, and there is no shortage of places to enjoy delicious food. From street food vendors to upscale restaurants, the city has something to offer for every palate.

One of the other highlights was trying out the local filter coffee. Bengaluru is famous for its filter coffee, and it’s a must-try for any visitor. The rich, aromatic coffee is served in a traditional steel tumbler and is the perfect way to start the day.
