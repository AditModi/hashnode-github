AWS Private Certificate Authority (AWS Private CA) launches the Connector for SCEP, which allows the secure and scalable enrollment of mobile devices using a managed cloud certificate authority (CA). Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol (SCEP) is widely used by mobile device management (MDM) solutions to obtain digital identity certificates from a CA. The Connector for SCEP simplifies the process, reduces operational costs, and optimizes public key infrastructure (PKI) by enabling the use of AWS Private CA with leading SCEP-compatible MDM solutions, including Microsoft Intune and Jamf Pro. This integration supports comprehensive certificate management across various platforms, extending AWS Private CA’s capabilities to Kubernetes, Active Directory, and now mobile devices.

### Generative AI Security Scoping Matrix and Built-in Security Controls

#### Generative AI Security Scoping Matrix:

AWS provides a comprehensive security scoping matrix for various AI use cases to ensure proper handling and protection of service data:

* **Consumer App:** Using “public” generative AI services.
    
* **Enterprise App:** Using an app or SaaS with generative AI features.
    
* **Pre-trained Models:** Building an app on a versioned model.
    
* **Fine-tuned Models:** Fine-tuning a model based on customer data.
    
* **Self-trained Models:** Training a model from scratch using customer data.
    

#### Handling Service Data Properly:

* **Know What You Have:** Understand what data you possess, where it is stored, how it is accessed, and the purposes for which it is used.
    
* **Trust Boundaries for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Establish clear trust boundaries to ensure secure data retrieval.
    
* **Continued Testing:** Regularly test AI systems to ensure they adhere to security standards.
    
* **Security Guardrails:** Utilize tools like GuardRails for Amazon Bedrock to enforce security policies.
    

#### AWS Generative AI Stack and Built-in Security Controls:

* **Amazon Q:** Tools and services such as Amazon Q Developer and Amazon Q Business help write secure and robust code.
    
* **Amazon Bedrock:** Ensures data security and privacy by encrypting data in transit and at rest. Data for customization is securely transferred through the customer’s VPC.
    
* **AWS Nitro System:** Provides zero-trust access to sensitive AI data, securing the AI infrastructure.
    

### AWS Audit Manager Extends Generative AI Best Practices Framework to Amazon SageMaker
