👉 After two years as a fully digital conference, HashiConf is returning to an in-person conference this year. HashiConf Global will be a hybrid event and take place in Los Angeles, California, and online from 4th-6th Oct, 2022. Let's hope that this year I can finally attend HashiConf Global in person 🙏

## What is HashiConf Global ?

👉 HashiConf is HashiCorp’s annual community conference where developers, system engineers, architects, and security professionals from organizations of all sizes gather in-person and online to share how the products in HashiCorp’s product stack help them provision, secure, connect, and run their business-critical applications.

👉 Get ready for two days of inspirational speakers, community connection, and a front-row seat to discussing infrastructure and security automation, modern application delivery, and the future of cloud with others who build and use HashiCorp tools every day.

👉 Over the past few years, HashiCorp has created a number of Open Source tools that provide cross-cutting infrastructure management in cloud and on-premises systems. Infrastructure automation standards have been established by these products.

👉 The conference is the ideal venue for those who wish to start learning about hashiCorp tools. You may find a wide range of information here, including technical workshops, product updates, and keynote addresses.

👉 Here are the 5 sessions at the top of my list for HashiConf Global, for Beginners!

👉 Before I continue, I should mention that you can get virtual tickets to HashiConf Global [here](), enabling you to remotely join live keynotes and other sessions. There are both live events and virtual events on this list.
