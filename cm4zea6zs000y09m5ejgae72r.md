As 2024 comes to a close, I’m taking a moment to reflect on a year filled with milestones, challenges, and immense gratitude. This year has been transformational in so many ways, and I’m excited to share some key highlights with you all.

#### Key Milestones

✨ **AWS Certifications**: Maintained my 12x AWS certifications and added three more to my portfolio! This year, I’ve been laser-focused on preparing for the AWS Machine Learning Specialty—a journey I’m eager to continue.

🎉 **AWS Ambassador**: Renewed my status as an AWS Ambassador while stepping into my dream role as an AWS Solutions Architect. This recognition fuels my passion for sharing knowledge and helping others navigate the AWS ecosystem.

🎤 **Speaking Across Borders**: Delivered impactful talks across diverse platforms and geographies—from Bengaluru, Pune, and Kochi to international stages like Hungary, Indonesia, Japan, China, and AllDayDevOps. Each session reinforced my commitment to sharing knowledge and connecting with the global tech community.

🤝 **Community Building**: Coordinated 12 monthly meetups and orchestrated two marquee events with AWS User Group Vadodara: the **AWS Community Day Vadodara** and the **GenAI Edition**. Both events saw incredible participation and reinforced the strength of our community. Huge thanks to AWS UG Vadodara and HUG Vadodara for their unwavering support.

📚 **Consistent Learning**: Managed to read a technology book every month, nurturing a habit that inspires me to stay curious and keep evolving.

#### Reflections: Challenges and Learnings 💔

While 2024 was full of achievements, it wasn’t without its share of lessons:

* **Consistency in Blogging**: Published over 40 AWS-focused blogs, but struggled with maintaining a regular schedule. This remains a priority for 2025.
    
* **Missed Opportunities**: Visa challenges kept me from attending key conferences in the USA. However, I’m determined to make this goal a reality next year.
    
* **Balancing Health**: Despite starting the year with fitness goals, I lost momentum. Health and wellness will take center stage in 2025.
    
* **Time for Loved Ones**: Juggling multiple commitments often made it difficult to prioritize personal relationships. Finding better balance is a key focus moving forward.
    

### Contributions: Speaking, Organizing, and Mentoring

2024 was a year of giving back—to the community, to aspiring professionals, and to the field of technology. From delivering impactful talks to organizing events and mentoring aspiring technologists, the year was packed with meaningful contributions. A detailed look at these contributions can be found in a separate blog dedicated to this topic.

### Looking Ahead: 2025 Goals

1. **Health First**: Build a consistent fitness routine and prioritize wellness.
    
2. **Expand Community Contributions**: Continue supporting AWS UG Vadodara, HUG Vadodara, and CloudTech while scaling back in-person events for better balance.
    
3. **Focus on Content**: Commit to regular blogging and exploring new topics in AWS and DevOps.
    
4. **Strengthen Relationships**: Dedicate more time to friends and family.
    
5. **Personal Growth**: Prepare for and achieve the AWS Machine Learning Specialty certification.
