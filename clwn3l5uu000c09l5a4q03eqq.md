#### **My Talk on Cost Optimization**

Following the keynote, I had the honor of speaking at the community lounge. My session, titled "Unveiling Cost Optimization Strategies: Slash AWS Expenses by 50%," was aimed at helping businesses and developers make the most of their AWS investments. The focus was on practical, real-world strategies to optimize costs without compromising on performance or scalability.

I shared several use cases from our work at Simform, demonstrating how we were able to achieve significant cost savings for our clients. For instance, by leveraging AWS Reserved Instances and Spot Instances, we were able to reduce compute costs dramatically. Additionally, using AWS Cost Explorer and Trusted Advisor, we provided our clients with actionable insights to eliminate waste and improve resource utilization.

The session was interactive, with many attendees asking questions and sharing their own experiences with cost optimization. It was a great opportunity to engage with the audience and learn from their perspectives. The discussions that followed were particularly enlightening, as they highlighted the common challenges faced by many organizations and the innovative solutions they’ve implemented to address these challenges.

Following the keynote, the day was filled with a variety of engaging sessions and hands-on workshops. These sessions covered a wide range of topics, from advanced cloud architecture and machine learning to serverless computing and DevOps best practices. Each session was designed to provide attendees with practical knowledge and skills that they could immediately apply in their work.

One of the workshops I attended was focused on building scalable and resilient applications using AWS services. The hands-on nature of the workshop allowed us to experiment with different AWS tools and services, guided by expert instructors. We worked on real-world scenarios, designing and deploying applications that could handle high traffic loads and recover quickly from failures. This practical experience was invaluable, as it reinforced the theoretical knowledge gained from the sessions.

#### **Booth Visits and Competitions**

#### **Community Lounge Talks**

The community lounge continued to be a hub of learning and collaboration on Day 2. There were several insightful talks and discussions throughout the day, each offering unique perspectives and valuable knowledge.

Two talks that particularly stood out for me were:

This initiative is close to my heart as AWS User Group Vadodara is actively involved in supporting it. Hearing about the progress these girls are making and the challenges they are overcoming was incredibly motivating. It’s a powerful reminder of the impact that technology and community support can have on people’s lives.

The community lounge talks were not only educational but also fostered a sense of camaraderie and mutual support among the attendees. It was wonderful to see so many passionate individuals coming together to share their knowledge and experiences.

### **Conclusion of Day 1 and Day 2**
