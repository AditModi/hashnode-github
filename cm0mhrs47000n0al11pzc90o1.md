In today's data-driven world, efficiently managing and analyzing time series data is crucial for businesses across various industries. Amazon Timestream offers a powerful solution for this, especially when combined with tools like InfluxDB and managed Grafana. This blog post explores the world of time series databases, delves into Amazon Timestream, and examines its practical applications, with a special focus on the financial services sector.

### Understanding Time Series Databases

**What is a Time Series Database?**

A time series database (TSDB) is designed to handle time-stamped or time series data. This data is collected chronologically and often generated at high frequency, making it challenging to manage with traditional databases.
