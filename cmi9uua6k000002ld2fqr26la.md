If you’re looking for an insightful recap of AWS Community Day Vadodara 2024, I highly recommend reading [Nirmal’s blog post here](https://nirmaldpathak.wordpress.com/2024/10/31/aws-community-day-vadodara-2024-a-roller-coaster-ride/). In this post, I’ll share my personal experiences organizing the event, focusing on my roles in social media, graphics, speaker management, and a lot of the behind-the-scenes work that often goes unnoticed.

## **Planning Begins — and So Does the Grind**

Our planning journey began in August 2024, right after our AWS User Group Vadodara Generative AI event. We held weekly sync-ups to ensure we were on track. As part of my responsibilities, I focused heavily on social media and graphic design. My goal was not just to inform our audience about the event, but to build excitement and set a visual tone that reflected the scale of the event we were preparing for.

What many people don’t see is the mountain of coordination that lies behind an event like this. I personally took charge of ensuring our social media presence, graphics, and branding were top-notch — sitting down with our graphics team, reviewing every draft, checking every post, making sure the design stayed consistent, clean, and on time. It’s not glamorous work, but for me, making sure the visual narrative of the event matched the ambition of our vision was non-negotiable.

I had a fantastic team of volunteers, and I encouraged them to take ownership. Sometimes I had to push a little to keep us on track, but we experimented with polls, countdowns, reels, and even a pre-event LinkedIn Live. There were days when delays forced me to step in and create graphics myself — something I had only lightly explored before. Balancing this during a family trip was chaotic; I was literally coordinating with the team while traveling, but the sense of progress made the effort worth it.

## **Volunteer Sync-Ups & Community Collaboration**

Beyond social media, we held regular sync-ups with our volunteers and college students to boost participation. These meetings were crucial — they helped us align our strategies, share ideas, and maintain momentum.

Thanks to the support from **Nirmal Pathak (AWS UG Leader)** and **Nilesh Vaghela (AWS Community Hero)**, we created a clear structure and expectations. Volunteers shared insights, brainstormed promotion ideas, and this collaborative energy made everyone feel invested in the success of the event. The sense of ownership among volunteers was something I was particularly proud of.

## **CFP, Speaker Selection & Lineup Curation**

One of my biggest responsibilities was the speaker lineup. I managed the CFP (Call for Papers), reviewed every submission carefully, and made the difficult calls of accepting or rejecting talks — all while keeping in mind the need for a balanced, diverse agenda.

It wasn’t just about filling slots; I wanted this year’s Community Day to feel complete.  
This meant:

* Local speakers
    
* Newcomers
    
* Experienced professionals from across India
    
* AWS speakers
    
* Women in tech
    
* A mix of beginner → intermediate → advanced content
    

This diversity was intentional. I followed up relentlessly on slides, posters, videos, and demo recordings. Behind the scenes, I was the invisible orchestration engine ensuring every speaker felt supported, informed, and ready — because good content doesn’t happen by accident.

With help from Nilesh bhai, who reached out to AWS speakers, we received a strong slate of submissions. Selecting the best ones was a challenge, but it was a good problem to have.

## **The Week Before: Chaos and Commitment**

Just three days before the event, one of our speakers had to drop out due to AWS approval issues. Priyal and I were initially supposed to be backups, but Priyal had commitments. After discussing with Nirmal bhai, I took up the topic myself. Stepping in last-minute wasn’t easy, especially while handling everything else, but AWS content is something I’m comfortable with — so I took it head-on.

On October 18th, we supported the AWS UG Women in Tech event. Interacting with speakers like **Ridhima Kapoor**, **Mahima Saran**, **Archana Kar**, and **Omshree Butani** was enriching, and it set a positive tone leading into the main event.

Later that afternoon, **Vikramaditya** and I roamed around the city collecting swags and mementos for the event — making sure everything was in place before the big day.

## **Event Setup: The Real Backstage Story**

At the venue, after aligning the social media and graphics teams, I moved into full execution mode.

### **Swag, Mementos & Last-Minute Fixes**

I spent hours ensuring all items were correct. I personally sat with our graphics designer to finalize speaker mementos — making sure each had accurate details and looked premium.

### **MoC, LED & Audio — The Invisible Work**

Then came the real time-sensitive coordination.  
I worked closely with the MoC team reviewing scripts, rehearsing transitions, and refining their flow. At the same time, I coordinated minute-to-minute with the LED and audio teams to ensure timing didn’t slip. This was crucial.

**This level of coordination is the reason we started and ended exactly on time — for the first time in years.**

A huge shoutout to **Shivang** for handling LED/audio flawlessly and to **Harsh**, who managed social media and graphics while I handled other areas.

## **Late Night Work, Quiz Prep & Career Counseling**

After all the setup, we had a pre-event dinner with speakers. I loved how **Nilesh bhai and Dimple ma’am** made our speakers feel welcomed — complete with a bit of Garba.

But my day wasn’t over.

I still had to:

* Finalize my session
    
* Prepare quiz questions with Priyal
    
* Structure the career counseling initiative
    
* Allocate attendees into time slots
    
* Assign them to experts
    

I wrapped everything up around 3 AM.

## **Event Day: Execution Under Pressure**

I reached the venue early, checked in with registration and the LED/audio team, and ensured everything was running as planned.

During **Mahima’s session**, I felt honored when she mentioned me on stage — something I will write about separately.

As the event unfolded, I managed the MoC and technical teams throughout the morning, trying (and failing) to find time for food. Thanks to Nirmal’s encouragement, I squeezed in a quick lunch before switching to manage the **advanced track**.

### **Career Counseling Initiative**

We had good participation, but I felt we could have structured it better. I apologize to anyone who felt let down — it’s a learning for future events.

### **My Session, Quiz & Closing**

My session went well (more on that later).  
The quiz and conclusion were handled wonderfully by Jay and Nirmal bhai. After that, I helped distribute goodies, and everyone enjoyed taking photos before wrapping up.

## **Post-Event Effort: The Work No One Sees**

Even after the event ended, my responsibilities continued.

Post-event work includes:

* Sending thank-you messages to speakers, sponsors, attendees
    
* Collecting and organizing photos from our internal team
    
* Creating and uploading the photo gallery
    
* Editing and uploading all event videos to YouTube
    

It’s tedious and time-consuming, but this is what transforms a one-day event into a lasting experience.

## **Reflection**

Looking back, AWS Community Day Vadodara 2024 wasn’t just another event for me — it was a culmination of months of unseen work, countless decisions, exhaustive coordination, and genuine passion. Every message, every design review, every call, every late night mattered.

It was exhausting, but I feel proud.  
Proud of the lineup, proud of the execution, and proud of how our community came together.

This journey reaffirmed why I do this:  
**not just to learn, but to build, to support, and to lift others along the way.**

Here’s to more Community Days, more builders, and more shared journeys. 🚀💛
