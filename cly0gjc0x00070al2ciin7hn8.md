In this section, we'll explore a complete data lifecycle workflow using open-source and third-party tools without relying on AWS services. This approach leverages powerful, scalable solutions that can be hosted on-premises or in any cloud environment, providing flexibility and control over your data infrastructure.

### Workflow 1: Batch Processing

#### Customer Problem

A financial services company needs to process vast amounts of transactional data from multiple sources, including bank transactions, online payments, and third-party financial services. The goal is to generate daily compliance reports, detect anomalies, and perform trend analysis. The existing system struggles with data integration and processing efficiency, leading to delayed reports and potential compliance risks.

    * **Why**: Airbyte is an open-source data integration platform that simplifies the process of extracting data from various sources and loading it into a central repository. It supports a wide range of connectors and is highly customizable, making it ideal for integrating diverse financial data sources.
        
2. **Data Storage**
    
    * **Tool**: **MinIO** and **Snowflake**
        
    * **Why**:
        
        * **MinIO**: An open-source object storage solution compatible with the S3 API. It provides high-performance, scalable storage for raw data.
            
        * **Snowflake**: A cloud-based data warehouse that offers powerful analytics capabilities. Snowflake’s architecture allows for efficient storage and querying of large datasets, making it suitable for the financial company’s analytical needs.
            
3. **Data Processing & Transformation**
    
    * **Tool**: **Apache Spark** and **dbt**
        
    * **Why**:
        
        * **Apache Spark**: An open-source unified analytics engine designed for large-scale data processing. Spark handles complex transformations and aggregations efficiently.
            
        * **dbt**: An open-source data transformation tool that enables data analysts and engineers to transform data in their warehouse using SQL. It simplifies the process of building and maintaining transformation workflows within Snowflake.
            
4. **Data Validation & Quality Checks**
    
    * **Tool**: **Great Expectations**
        
    * **Why**: Great Expectations is a flexible data validation framework that helps ensure data quality. By integrating it into the batch processing workflow, the financial company can enforce data quality standards and catch errors early in the pipeline.
        
5. **Data Orchestration**
    
    * **Tool**: **Apache Airflow**
        
    * **Why**: Apache Airflow is an open-source platform for programmatically authoring, scheduling, and monitoring workflows. It provides robust orchestration capabilities, ensuring that data ingestion, processing, validation, and storage steps are executed reliably and in the correct sequence.
        

**Detailed Steps**:

1. **Airbyte** extracts transactional data from various financial systems and loads it into **MinIO**.
    
2. Raw data is stored in **MinIO**.
    
3. **Apache Spark** processes and transforms the data, preparing it for analysis.
    
4. **Great Expectations** validates the transformed data to ensure it meets quality standards.
    
5. Processed and validated data is loaded into **Snowflake**.
    
6. **dbt** transforms and models the data within Snowflake for final reporting and analysis.
    
7. **Apache Airflow** orchestrates the entire workflow, ensuring each step is executed as scheduled and managing dependencies between tasks.
    

### Workflow 2: Real-Time Processing

#### Customer Problem

A media streaming company needs to process real-time user interaction data to monitor platform performance, provide personalized content recommendations, and detect fraudulent activities. The company faces challenges with data latency, scalability, and processing efficiency. The existing system cannot handle the real-time data volume, leading to delayed insights and poor user experience.

#### Chosen Tools and Rationale

1. **Data Ingestion**
    
    * **Tool**: **Apache Kafka**
        
    * **Why**: Apache Kafka is a highly scalable and distributed event streaming platform that handles high-throughput, low-latency data streams. It is ideal for capturing real-time user interactions from the streaming platform.
        
2. **Data Storage**
    
    * **Tool**: **Apache Cassandra**
        
    * **Why**: Apache Cassandra is a NoSQL database designed for high availability and scalability, providing low-latency data storage and retrieval. It ensures that the real-time data is accessible for immediate processing.
        
3. **Data Processing & Transformation**
    
    * **Tool**: **Apache Flink**
        
    * **Why**: Apache Flink is an open-source stream processing framework known for its low-latency and high-throughput capabilities. It enables the media company to process and analyze data streams in real-time, generating insights and triggering actions based on user interactions.
        
4. **Data Validation & Quality Checks**
    
    * **Tool**: **Great Expectations** (used in batch mode for sampled real-time data)
        
    * **Why**: To maintain data quality, periodic batch validations using Great Expectations on sampled data ensure that the real-time data streams meet the required standards without impacting performance.
        
5. **Data Storage & Access**
    
    * **Tool**: **ClickHouse**
        
    * **Why**: ClickHouse is an open-source columnar database management system optimized for real-time analytics. It allows the media company to run quick queries on processed data for immediate insights and reporting.
        
6. **Data Orchestration**
    
    * **Tool**: **Apache Airflow**
        
    * **Why**: Apache Airflow orchestrates the real-time data pipeline, ensuring that data ingestion, processing, validation, and storage steps are executed smoothly and efficiently.
        

**Detailed Steps**:

1. **Apache Kafka** streams user interaction data from the media platform.
    
2. Real-time data is stored in **Apache Cassandra** for low-latency access.
    
3. **Apache Flink** processes and analyzes the data streams in real-time, generating immediate insights and triggering actions.
    
4. **Great Expectations** performs periodic batch validations on sampled data to ensure quality.
    
5. Processed data is stored in **ClickHouse** for real-time analytics.
