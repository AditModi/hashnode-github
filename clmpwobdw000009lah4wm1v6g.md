As we celebrate International Women's Day, it's important to highlight the challenges faced by women in the technology industry and recognize the programs and initiatives that are working towards creating a more inclusive and diverse industry.

One such program is AWS re/Start, a free, full-time, 12-week training program that helps individuals who are unemployed or underemployed launch a new career in the cloud computing industry. This program is open to everyone, including women, and is designed to help people with little or no experience in IT.

Another program that AWS offers is CloudUp for her, an eight-week, community-based learning program specifically designed for women. Whether you're a student thinking about a career in tech or a professional looking to re-skill, cross-skill, or simply cloud-curious, this program is for you! This flexible program provides an excellent opportunity for women to gain valuable cloud computing skills.

AWS also offers She Builds Tech Skills, a program that provides free virtual training on the latest trends and best practices in cloud technology. The program is designed to create an inclusive and supportive environment for technical skills development, with events and programs focused on technical skills enhancement through hands-on-keyboards style learning for women and those from underrepresented communities. She Builds Tech Skills aims to empower more women to build STEM careers and develop into the future leaders in technology.

I'm passionate about driving innovation and supporting the development of technical skills. With my involvement in various communities, I understand the importance of staying up-to-date with the latest trends and best practices in the field. I'm committed to helping aspiring technologists, especially women, grow their careers and develop their skills.

The technology industry has come a long way in terms of inclusivity and diversity, but there is still much work to be done. Programs like AWS re/Start, CloudUp for her, and She Builds Tech Skills are just a few examples of the initiatives that are working towards creating a more inclusive and diverse industry. As we celebrate International Women's Day, let's continue to support and uplift women in tech and work towards building a more inclusive and diverse industry.
