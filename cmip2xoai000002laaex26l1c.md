Day 1 at AWS re:Invent 2025 opened with Matt Garman’s first keynote as CEO of AWS — and he made the theme very clear:

This is the era of AI, and AWS is building for it from the ground up.

What I appreciated most was how structured the entire keynote felt. Instead of scattering announcements, Matt framed the future of AWS AI around four core pillars:

1. AI Infrastructure
    
2. Inference Platform
    
3. Your Data
    
4. Tools to Build Agents
    

Each section had a clear purpose, deep technical details, and — something I found genuinely refreshing — customer use cases woven in live on stage. Hearing from Sony, Adobe, and Writer brought the announcements to life in a way only real implementations can.

Here’s my deep dive into everything that stood out.

Matt began by giving a heartfelt shoutout to AWS Heroes, Community Builders, and User Group Leaders, saying these are the people “building the future of cloud.” As someone active in the AWS community, this hit home — it’s rare for a keynote to start by highlighting community.

**1\. AI Infrastructure: Powering the Next Decade of Compute**

Then came the infra announcements.

**🔹 AWS AI Factories**

A massive step forward in scaling enterprise AI workflows end-to-end. Think of it as the modern assembly line for model training, data prep, evaluation, and deployment — built natively on AWS.

**🔹 Trn3 Ultra Server + Trn4 (coming soon)**

Seeing the actual server on stage was such a throwback. AWS usually keeps hardware behind the curtain, so showcasing the Trn3 Ultra physically felt symbolic — like saying, “Yes, we’re serious about custom silicon.”

Trn4 was teased as the next leap in AWS’s custom training accelerators.

**2\. The Inference Platform: Bedrock Levels Up**

This section probably had the broadest set of updates because inference is where most organizations are investing today.

**🔹 New foundation models added to Amazon Bedrock:**

* Gemma
    
* Qwen
    
* NVIDIA models
    
* Mistral
    
* Others tailored for multilingual, high-performance, and efficiency use cases
    

A diverse model catalog is becoming table stakes, and AWS is clearly moving fast here.

**🔹 Nova 2 — Sonic, Lite, Pro + Nova 2 Omni**

The second-generation Nova lineup delivers faster inference, lower latency, and stronger multimodal capabilities.

Nova 2 Omni continues the push toward unified multimodal reasoning.

Customer Perspective:

Adobe walked through how they are leveraging Bedrock models to bring more powerful generative workflows into creative tools. Their focus on reliability, governance, and scale resonated with many enterprise builders.

**3\. Your Data: Introducing Nova Forge**

This was one of the most important announcements — even if it didn’t get the loudest applause.

**🔹 Nova Forge**

A new way to unify, transform, and prepare data specifically for AI workflows.

While everyone talks about models, every real-world builder knows:

Your AI is only as good as your data.

Nova Forge simplifies that bridge.

Customer Perspective:

Writer shared how they use data transformation and orchestration to deliver high-quality enterprise AI copilots. Seeing a content-focused AI company emphasize data engineering was refreshing — and honest.

**4\. Tools to Build Agents: The Future of Application Logic**

This was perhaps the most “forward-looking” part of the keynote.

AWS is betting big on agents, and not just as a feature… but as a new way to build software.

**🔹 Policy in AgentCore**

Gives developers fine-grained governance and secure behavior controls for agents.

**🔹 Evaluations in AgentCore**

Lets builders measure and improve agent performance using structured, repeatable evaluation frameworks.

**🔹 Frontier Agents**

AWS previewed three next-generation, purpose-specific agents:

* Kiro – Autonomous, multi-step decision-making
    
* Security Agent – Automated detection and remediation
    
* DevOps Agent – Assists with deployments, debugging, and operations
    

Partner Spotlight:

Matt also highlighted partners building AI products and services through AWS Marketplace — an ecosystem that’s growing rapidly.

**🔹 Amazon Connect**

**Modernizing the Old to Build the New: Amazon Transform Custom**

This one is for the enterprises struggling with aging monoliths and outdated dependencies.

**🔹 Amazon Transform Custom**

Designed to modernize legacy codebases, handle language/version upgrades, and simplify refactoring.

Modernization is one of the least glamorous but most expensive parts of enterprise engineering — so this felt like a much-needed addition.

**And Finally… the Non-AI Announcements (in the last 10 minutes!)**

Just when the audience started wondering whether the entire keynote would be 100% AI-focused, Matt rapid-fired through a series of non-AI updates:

* AWS Lambda Durable Functions
    
* S3 Storage Limit Increase
    
* S3 Intelligent Tiering for vector workloads
    
* New S3 Access Point for NetApp ONTAP
    
* Updates in Security Hub
    
* Enhancements to GuardDuty
    
* CloudWatch Unified Data Store
    
* And my personal favorite: Database Savings Plans
    

This was a reminder:

While AI is the headline, AWS is still building across every layer of cloud.

**Final Thoughts**

This keynote was a confident statement of direction:

AI is the center of gravity — but AWS is building the full stack, not just the model layer.

From custom silicon to agent tooling to real customer stories, the narrative felt grounded and intentional.
