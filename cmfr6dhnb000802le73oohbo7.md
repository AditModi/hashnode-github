In today’s fast-paced world of DevOps, automation is the key to ensuring rapid delivery, consistent environments, and robust infrastructure management. As organizations embrace **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**, the next logical step is to introduce automation and version-controlled workflows, which is where **GitOps** comes in.

In this blog post, we’ll explore how **GitOps** integrates with IaC to automate infrastructure deployments, the tools that facilitate GitOps workflows, and real-world examples using **Terraform** and **AWS CDK**. We’ll also discuss how to manage infrastructure rollbacks, drift management, and overall workflow efficiency with GitOps.

### **1\. What is GitOps?**

GitOps is a modern approach to Continuous Deployment (CD) for cloud-native applications, where **Git repositories** serve as the **single source of truth** for infrastructure and application deployment. GitOps empowers teams to use **Git** workflows (pull requests, branches, and merges) to manage and deploy infrastructure, ensuring automation, traceability, and consistency.

The key principle of GitOps is that the entire infrastructure is managed and deployed via **Git** repositories. Changes to the infrastructure are made through commits to the repository, and tools like **ArgoCD**, **FluxCD**, or **Jenkins X** automatically detect and apply these changes to the cloud environment.

### **2\. How GitOps Works with IaC**

With **IaC** tools like **Terraform** and **AWS CDK**, GitOps simplifies infrastructure management by automating the deployment process. Here’s how GitOps and IaC work together:

* **Git as the Source of Truth**: The state of your infrastructure (whether it’s Terraform configuration files, CloudFormation templates, or AWS CDK code) is stored in a Git repository. Any change to the infrastructure must go through Git, ensuring full version control and auditability.
    
* **Declarative Infrastructure**: Using IaC tools, you define your infrastructure in a **declarative** manner (e.g., "this EC2 instance should exist, configured with these specs"). The GitOps tools automatically apply these changes, ensuring that the actual state matches the desired state.
    
* **Automation**: Once the changes are pushed to Git, GitOps tools monitor the repository for updates. Whenever new changes are detected, the GitOps tools trigger an automated pipeline to apply those changes, ensuring consistency across environments without manual intervention.

### **3\. GitOps Tools: ArgoCD & FluxCD**

To implement GitOps effectively, you’ll need a GitOps tool that can watch your Git repositories and automatically deploy your infrastructure changes. Two of the most popular tools are **ArgoCD** and **FluxCD**.

#### **3.1 ArgoCD**

**ArgoCD** is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes that enables you to manage your Kubernetes applications and infrastructure through Git. ArgoCD automatically syncs changes from Git repositories to your Kubernetes clusters, and it provides a real-time UI for monitoring deployments and troubleshooting.

* **ArgoCD Workflow**:
    
    1. Store Kubernetes YAML or Helm charts in Git repositories.
        
    2. ArgoCD continuously monitors Git repositories for changes.
        
    3. When changes are detected (e.g., a new application or service definition), ArgoCD automatically applies those changes to your Kubernetes clusters.
        
    4. ArgoCD can also manage rollbacks in case of deployment failures.
        

#### **3.2 FluxCD**

**FluxCD** is another popular tool for implementing GitOps with Kubernetes. It synchronizes the desired state defined in Git repositories with the state of the cluster. Flux is lightweight, integrates well with Helm, and supports both **Continuous Delivery** and **Continuous Deployment**.

* **FluxCD Workflow**:
    
    1. Define your Kubernetes manifests or Helm charts in Git repositories.
        
    2. FluxCD monitors these repositories for changes.
        
    3. Upon detecting a change, FluxCD automatically applies the updates to the Kubernetes cluster.
        
    4. FluxCD offers a reconciliation process, where the system continuously checks and enforces the state defined in Git.

### **4\. Real-World GitOps Workflows with Terraform and AWS CDK**

In a **Terraform** or **AWS CDK**\-based GitOps workflow, infrastructure changes are defined in the code (either HCL for Terraform or TypeScript/Python for AWS CDK), committed to Git, and automatically deployed via a GitOps tool like **ArgoCD** or **FluxCD**.

#### **4.1 GitOps with Terraform**

Using **Terraform** for GitOps involves storing your Terraform configuration in a Git repository, and leveraging GitOps tools to automatically apply those configurations.

**Steps**:

1. Store Terraform configurations (e.g., [`main.tf`](http://main.tf), [`variables.tf`](http://variables.tf)) in a Git repository.
    
2. Use a CI/CD pipeline like **GitHub Actions** or **GitLab CI** to trigger Terraform deployments when a change is pushed to the repository.
    
3. Terraform can be paired with **ArgoCD** to automatically apply configurations to your cloud environment (e.g., AWS, Azure).
    

Here’s an example using GitHub Actions and Terraform for a GitOps workflow:

```yaml
name: Terraform Deployment

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  terraform:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Terraform
        uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v1

      - name: Initialize Terraform
        run: terraform init

      - name: Plan Terraform
        run: terraform plan

      - name: Apply Terraform
        run: terraform apply -auto-approve    
```

Every time a change is pushed to the `main` branch, the workflow runs, applying the new infrastructure changes to your cloud environment.

#### **4.2 GitOps with AWS CDK**

With **AWS CDK**, infrastructure is written in high-level programming languages (e.g., TypeScript, Python, Java). You can integrate AWS CDK into a GitOps pipeline similarly to Terraform. You would store your AWS CDK code in Git, use a GitOps tool to monitor the repository, and deploy AWS resources based on the code changes.

For example, using **FluxCD** with AWS CDK:

1. Store AWS CDK app code in a Git repository.
    
2. Use a CI/CD tool to trigger an AWS CDK deployment pipeline when code is pushed to the repository.
    
3. Deploy infrastructure changes to AWS.
    
    ```bash
    cdk deploy --profile myAWSProfile    
    ```
    

After the changes are committed and the pipeline runs, the AWS CDK tool deploys the new infrastructure resources to your AWS environment.

### **5\. Handling Rollbacks and Drift Management in GitOps**

One of the significant benefits of GitOps is the ability to **easily manage rollbacks** and **drift** between the declared state and the actual state of the infrastructure.

#### **5.1 Rollbacks in GitOps**

If a deployment goes wrong, you can **rollback** changes simply by reverting the corresponding commit in the Git repository and pushing it. This automatically triggers the rollback process in your GitOps tool (e.g., ArgoCD or FluxCD), ensuring the infrastructure is reverted to the previous stable state.

For example, using **ArgoCD**, a rollback is as simple as:

1. Revert the changes in the Git repository.
    
2. ArgoCD detects the change and rolls back the deployment to the previous stable version.
    

#### **5.2 Drift Management**

Infrastructure drift occurs when the actual state of the infrastructure diverges from the desired state defined in your IaC files. GitOps tools continuously monitor this drift and can either alert you or automatically sync the actual state with the desired state in the repository.

Tools like **ArgoCD** provide real-time visibility into this drift, ensuring that the infrastructure state matches the code. If drift is detected, the tool can initiate a sync process, bringing the infrastructure back in line with the repository.

### **6\. Benefits of GitOps for IaC**

* **Automation**: GitOps automates infrastructure deployments, reducing human error and speeding up the delivery process.
    
* **Consistency**: Ensures that the infrastructure is always consistent with the Git repository, avoiding configuration drift.
    
* **Auditability**: Since all changes are made via Git commits, you have full traceability of who changed what and when.
    
* **Rollback**: GitOps enables easy rollbacks by simply reverting commits, providing a safe way to manage failures.
    
* **Declarative Nature**: GitOps promotes a declarative approach where you describe the desired state, and the system ensures that this state is achieved, simplifying complex infrastructure management.
