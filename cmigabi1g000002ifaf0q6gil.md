If you’re like me, preparing for AWS re:Invent 2025 can quickly feel overwhelming. With dozens (or even hundreds) of sessions across multiple tracks — containers, ML/AI, security, cloud optimization — it’s all too easy to get lost.

That’s why what really helped me was using the **official session-track guides from AWS**. They help cut through the noise, save time, and make sure what ends up on your calendar is *actionable* and aligned with your work.

So I decided to build my own schedule — and along the way, I put together a reference list of all the best track guides. If you’re attending re:Invent (or even just following remotely), I hope these help you as much as they helped me.

### 📚 Key Session Guides for re:Invent 2025

* **Containers & ECS** — Explore the latest updates and deep-dives in containers with the ECS Track.
    
* **EKS & Kubernetes** — Sessions covering Kubernetes orchestration, best practices, and more on EKS.
    
* **Developer Tools** — For CI/CD, infrastructure-as-code, dev-ops workflows, and building faster with AWS tools.
    
* **ML / AI (Quick Suite)** — From ML frameworks to AI-powered services — ideal if you’re diving into ML/AI on AWS.
    
* **Well-Architected & Cloud Optimization** — Learn how to build secure, scalable, cost-efficient AWS environments.
    
* **Analytics** — Big data, data lakes, real-time analytics, and modern data infrastructure on AWS.
    
* **Security** — Identity, governance, compliance, securing workloads — must-see for anyone responsible for cloud security.
    
* **Cloud Governance** — Best practices around compliance, resource governance, and organizational controls in AWS.
    
* **Compute** — EC2, serverless, edge computing — core infrastructure topics for running workloads on AWS.
    

**Bonus:**

* **AWS Heroes Guide** — A curated list of sessions recommended by AWS Heroes. These tend to deliver some of the most practical and high-impact insights. If you want to cut through the noise, this is your fastest shortcut.

### Why I Recommend These Guides

* **Efficient scheduling** — Instead of browsing every session individually, track-level guides let you mass-filter by area of interest.
    
* **Actionable focus** — The guides highlight sessions that are likely to deliver practical value — from production-ready architecture tips to cloud-optimization ideas.
    
* **Broad coverage** — Whether you’re a dev, architect, security lead, or data person, there’s a track for you.
    
* **Perspective of experts** — Especially the Heroes-curated track: you get what seasoned practitioners believe is most worth your time.

### How I’m Using Them This Year

1. Start by selecting 2–3 tracks relevant to my current work (for me: Containers, Cloud Optimization, Analytics).
    
2. Review the session guides and shortlist 5–10 sessions per track.
    
3. Cross-reference with my work calendar to avoid conflicts.
    
4. Leave a few slots open — for “wild-card” sessions that seem interesting but weren’t on my radar.
    
5. After re:Invent, archive the session summaries to build a personal AWS reference library.

If you’re also going to re:Invent this year — or just following along remotely — I strongly recommend giving these guides a look. They saved me hours of schedule-scrolling, and helped me focus on what really matters.

If you like — once the official guides are all live — I can help you build a **personalized session schedule** (based on your interests and background) to get the most out of re:Invent 2025.

See you at the sessions — and may your re:Invent schedule be powerful and purposeful!
