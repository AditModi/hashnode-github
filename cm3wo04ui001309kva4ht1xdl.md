As someone who is passionate about community building, I firmly believe that everything I doâ€”whether itâ€™s speaking, writing, or sharing my knowledgeâ€”is to help the community grow and thrive. I donâ€™t get paid by my company for speaking at events, and all my travel expenses come out of my own pocket. But the value I get from being part of such incredible communities far outweighs any financial investment.

This blog post is about my recent experience speaking at AWS Community Day Indonesia in Jakarta, which was my very first in-person international conference. While Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to speak at various online events, presenting in person for the first time was an entirely new challenge. But it was an experience Iâ€™ll never forget.

\### The Journey Begins

It all started when I submitted my CFP (Call for Papers) for AWS Community Day in Indonesia. At the time, I had recently switched roles at work, and it was a particularly challenging period. Nevertheless, I was fortunate enough to have my session accepted. My company was supportive and allowed me to present, which I was incredibly grateful for.

Since I had never been to Jakarta before, I needed some guidance on how to plan my trip. Thatâ€™s when I reached out to Ankit, a fellow AWS community member from AWS User Group Ahmedabad. I had seen that his session was also accepted, so I figured he would be a great person to help me navigate the logistics. Ankit has been visiting Jakarta frequently, and his knowledge of the city was invaluable. He recommended areas to stay, things to try, and, of course, local food to sample.

Thanks to Ankitâ€™s insights, I quickly booked my flights and accommodation. The visa was on arrival, so there was no hassle there. With that sorted, it was time to turn my attention to preparing for my session.

\### Preparing for the Session

Given my recent role switch, preparing for the session was a bit more challenging than usual. However, since I have extensive experience with AWS Control Tower, I was able to put together my slides and demos relatively quickly. I was also preparing a similar session for AWS UG Kochi, so I used the opportunity to work on both presentations at the same time, which made the process smoother.

\### Arriving in Jakarta

I arrived in Jakarta on Friday and spent some time roaming around the city. It was a great way to get acquainted with the local culture. Ankit and I had an enjoyable dinner together, chatting about everything from AWS to community-building, before getting some rest for the big day ahead.

\### The Event Day

On the day of the event, Ankit and I traveled to the venue together with some help from Ananda, a key organizer and an AWS Container Hero who played a significant role in making the event successful. We made our way to the speaker lounge, where Jason from the volunteer team was there to help us with any needs.

Unfortunately, we missed Amandaâ€™s speech, but we had a quick peek at what Shafraz was saying, followed by the main keynote from Donnie. Iâ€™ve had a few virtual interactions with Donnie, and it was really exciting to see him present in person. His ability to break down complex concepts into easy-to-understand terms is something I really admire.

While in the speaker room, I had the chance to meet Luthfi, an AWS Community Builder and HashiCorp Ambassador. Luthfi and I had interacted virtually at the Japan AWS UG "JAWS Pankration 2024" where we presented one after another. It was great to finally meet him in person, and we had a wonderful time talking about our shared interests in community building and cloud technologies.

I also had the opportunity to talk with Eryan Airobowo, an AWS Solutions Architect, who gave me valuable insights into AWSâ€™s activities in Indonesia and how the community can play a role in these initiatives. It was really fulfilling to contribute ideas and share my thoughts on AWSâ€™s growing presence in the region.

\### Booths, Networking, and Discussions

After some quick checks of my presentation slides, I took a moment to explore the various booths and activities happening at the event. I even picked up my badge! One of the highlights of the day was my lengthy conversation with Ananda, where we discussed AWS communities, her work, and our shared excitement over the upcoming opportunities for AWS in Southeast Asia. We also talked about Shafraz and Albert, who were unfortunately unable to attend in person. Both of them play such integral roles in the AWS community, and it would have been amazing to catch up with them face-to-face. Itâ€™s conversations like these that remind me of the true power of AWS Communitiesâ€”connecting with like-minded people and building meaningful relationships.

Luthfiâ€™s workshop session was another highlight. It was interactive, practical, and filled with insights that I could immediately relate to and apply. Afterward, Ankit, and I had an early lunch, trying some local delicacies suggested by Ananda. As a vegetarian, I couldnâ€™t sample everything, but I did try a few dishes and was pleasantly surprised by how flavorful the food was.

I had the chance to connect with Saipol, a fellow AWS Community Builder and data engineering enthusiast. We had a great discussion about AWS and the future of data engineering in the cloud. Later, I also had insightful conversations with Beny, who presented a fantastic topic on AI/ML with AWS. These discussions gave me a deeper understanding of the cutting-edge work being done in the AWS ecosystem, especially around artificial intelligence and machine learning.

\### Meeting More AWS Community Members

After lunch, Ankit and I visited a few more booths, took some photos, and spoke with organizers like Azmi Faiz Habibi and Dimas khoysi triangga about the AWS community in Jakarta. Everyone was so welcoming, and it was evident that the community was eager to learn and grow together.

I also had a chance to meet Cheryl from ClickHouse, whom I knew virtually. It was great to finally meet in person and discuss potential AWS meetups in Vadodara, where ClickHouse would be happy to support us.

The highlight of the day was finally catching up with Donnie. Ankit and I had an engaging discussion with him about AWS and few AWS services that Donnie is involved with. We even pulled his leg a couple of timesâ€”after all, what are friends for? We got so caught up in the conversation that we almost missed our session! But I rushed back to my room just in time for my presentation.

\### My Session on AWS Control Tower

Presenting my session on implementing AWS Control Tower and best practices for multi-account environments was an exhilarating experience. Although I took a bit longer than planned (about 30 minutes), everything went smoothly, and the attendees seemed engaged. What really stood out was the number of questions I received after the session. I spent an additional 20-30 minutes discussing AWS Control Tower best practices with 2 attendees, and it was incredibly rewarding to see such genuine interest.

\### Wrapping Up

After the session, I had more meaningful discussions with other speakers, including Amanda and Donnie. We didnâ€™t manage to take any pictures, but I truly enjoyed the conversations we had. The event culminated in a special dinner arranged by the community organizers, but unfortunately, we had to leave early. Iâ€™d like to take a moment to appreciate the stunning venueâ€”CCITâ€”which felt more like a resort than a conference center. The location was truly beautiful, especially as the evening lights lit up the space.

The next day, I spent some time exploring Jakarta before catching my flight back home, reflecting on the incredible experience I had. It was an unforgettable opportunity to learn, share, and connect with the AWS community in a new part of the world.

\### Conclusion

Iâ€™m deeply thankful to the organizers, fellow speakers, and the AWS community in Jakarta for making this event such a memorable experience. The relationships and insights I gained will stay with me for a long time. If youâ€™re ever in Vadodara, Gujarat, feel free to reach outâ€”Iâ€™ll be more than happy to connect and share what Iâ€™ve learned. And who knows? Maybe we can collaborate on a future AWS meetup!

Until next time, Jakarta!
