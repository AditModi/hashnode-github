## **How a Weekend Project Became a Community Icebreaker**

Let me take you back to a few months ago, when our AWS User Group Vadodara was gearing up for another meetup. If you’ve ever organized a tech event, you know the drill: finding speakers, finalizing sponsors, prepping the agenda, and—most importantly—figuring out how to make the event feel less like a classroom and more like a community.

I’ve always believed that the best part of these meetups isn’t just the talks or the swag (though, let’s be honest, free t-shirts never hurt). It’s the people—the random conversations over chai, the jokes about AWS bills, the shared pain of debugging at 2 AM. But breaking the ice? That’s always tricky. Most of us are introverts at heart, and nobody wants to be the first to raise their hand or walk up to a stranger.

So I started thinking: what if we had something fun and uniquely Indian that could get people talking before the event even started? Something that would make you laugh, maybe poke a little fun at our tech culture, and—if we’re lucky—spark a few new friendships.

## **The Spark: Blending Cloud Careers With Desi Humor**

That’s how the idea for the **Desi Cloud Job Title Generator** was born. I wanted to create a tiny web app that would let you build your own “cloud persona”—but with a desi twist. Not just “Cloud Architect” or “DevOps Engineer,” but titles like “Lambda Lassi Master” or “Cybersecurity Chowkidar.” Something you’d want to share in your WhatsApp group or as your next LinkedIn headline (okay, maybe not, but you get the idea).

The first version was as simple as it gets:

* Pick your favorite AWS service (EC2, Lambda, S3, etc.)
    
* Choose your work style (are you a Frugal Innovator or a Deadline Crusher?)
    
* Select your “cloud superpower” (can you debug without Stack Overflow or survive on airport Wi-Fi before a demo?)
    

Hit “Generate,” and you’d get a job title that might make you snort-laugh at your desk. Each title came with a little description—a tongue-in-cheek summary of your new persona. And because I can’t resist a good easter egg, I even added a secret Konami code for those who love to explore.

## **Building for the Community, Not Just for Myself**

What surprised me wasn’t just how much fun it was to build, but how quickly the community responded. I shared the link in our group chat, and suddenly people were posting their titles everywhere. Folks started competing for the quirkiest combo. Someone even suggested printing their title on their event badge!

I realized then that this wasn’t just a toy—it was a way to break down barriers, get people talking, and remind us all that tech doesn’t have to be so serious all the time.

## **The Tech: Simple, Fast, and Open**

I wanted anyone to be able to use this, so I kept the tech stack as simple as possible:

* **Frontend:** Pure HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. No frameworks, no build tools—just open and go.
    
* **Backend:** AWS Lambda + API Gateway, with the option to plug in AWS Bedrock (Claude 3 Haiku) for AI-powered fun.
    
* **Hosting:** S3 + CloudFront, or you can deploy to AWS Amplify in minutes.
    
* **Extras:** Avatar generator, leaderboards, and yes—hidden surprises for the curious.
    

And here’s the best part: thanks to Amazon Q CLI, I could scaffold the whole thing in under half an hour. Q CLI helped me break the app into logical components, pick the right AWS services, and even auto-generate CloudFormation templates. What would’ve taken me a weekend to wire up was ready before my chai got cold.

## **The Evolution: Listening to the Community**

After the first event, I started getting feedback—lots of it. People wanted more work styles, more superpowers, and even crazier job titles. So I went back to the drawing board:

* **Expanded Work Styles:** Added “Calm Under Pressure,” “Mentor,” “Minimalist,” “Relationship Builder,” and more—because our community is more than just code.
    
* **Superpowers With a Desi Twist:** “Finds parking in Bangalore,” “Predicts when the manager will call,” “Works with stable internet on Indian trains,” and other uniquely Indian skills.
    
* **Dual Generation System:** Some folks loved the hand-crafted templates, while others wanted the unpredictability of AI. Now, you can toggle between classic and AI-powered title generation.
    
* **Bedrock Integration:** Even if you don’t have an API key, you can try the mock version. If you want to go live, it’s just a config change away.
    

Every suggestion, every laugh, every “hey, can you add this?” made the app better. And that’s what I love about building in the open—your users aren’t just testers, they’re co-creators.

## **Why This Matters: More Than Just a Game**

You might be wondering—why put so much effort into something so…silly? Here’s the thing: community isn’t just about learning or networking. It’s about belonging. When you see someone else with the same weird job title as you, or you both laugh at the same “airport Wi-Fi” joke, you’re not just attendees—you’re part of something bigger.

The Desi Cloud Job Title Generator is my small way of saying, “You belong here.” Whether you’re a first-timer or a regular, a student or a CTO, there’s a place (and a funny title) for you in our community.

## **Make It Yours: Open, Templatized, and Ready to Remix**

One of my goals was to make this app reusable for any AWS User Group, anywhere in India (or the world!). Everything is templatized:

* Plug in your community name, event dates, and meetup links.
    
* Add your own branding, city, or even local jokes.
    
* Want to add another game or quiz? The backend is modular—go for it!
    

You don’t need to be a cloud guru to set it up. Just clone the repo, customize a few variables, and you’re live.  
Here’s how easy it is:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AditModi/desi-cloud-job-generator.git
cd desi-cloud-job-generator
open index.html
```

Or, push to GitHub and connect to AWS Amplify. You’ll be up and running before your next chai break.

## **Final Thoughts: From One Community Builder to Another**

This project started as a weekend experiment, but it’s become something I genuinely love sharing with others. If you’re organizing a meetup, hackathon, or just want to add a little desi flavor to your tech community, give it a try. Remix it, improve it, and make it your own.

And if you ever get the title “Deadline Crusher of DynamoDB” or “Frugal Innovator of Lambda Functions,” come find me at the next AWS UG Vadodara event—I’ll buy you a chai.

Because at the end of the day, every great cloud architect started with a single API call…and a whole lot of community.

If you need help setting it up, want to suggest a new work style, or just want to geek out about AWS, my DMs are always open. Let’s keep building—together.
