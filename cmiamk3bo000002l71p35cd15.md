AWS just gave Bedrock a powerful new lever for balancing **speed vs cost**. Bedrock now offers three inference service tiers — **Priority**, **Standard**, and **Flex** — so you can choose performance based on what your AI workload really needs.

---

### Why This Matters

* Not all AI workloads are the same.
    
    * Some need **real-time responses** (e.g., chatbots or live translation).
        
    * Others are more lenient on latency (e.g., summarizations, batch model evaluations).
        
* By picking a tier per API call, you no longer overpay for speed when you don’t need it — or compromise on latency when every millisecond matters.

### The Tiers — What They Mean

| Tier | Use Case | What You Get |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Priority** | Mission-critical, real-time apps (chatbots, live AI assistants) | Preferential compute allocation → lower latency, especially during high demand.

| **Standard** | Everyday generative AI tasks (content gen, document processing) | Reliable, consistent performance at regular pricing.

| **Flex** | Cost-sensitive workloads that can wait (evaluations, summarizations, multi-step agents) | Cheaper tier with higher latency, but very cost-efficient.

### How to Use It — Immediately

1. Call the Bedrock inference API with an extra parameter:
    
    ```bash
    {
      "service_tier": "priority" | "default" | "flex"
    }
    ```
    
2. Pick the tier **on a per-invocation basis**. You don’t need separate deployments.
    
3. Monitor your usage and latency: CloudWatch has metrics for “model-id + priority” and “model-id + flex.”
    
4. Use the **AWS Pricing Calculator** to estimate how much each tier will cost for your expected usage.

### When to Use Which Tier

* **Priority**: For anything that directly affects your users and needs fast, reliable responses.
    
* **Standard**: For all-round workloads where responsiveness is important but not critical.
    
* **Flex**: For non-urgent tasks or background workflows where you want to minimize cost.
    

---

### Trade-Offs to Consider

* **Latency vs Cost**: Flex is cheaper, but slower. Make sure the workflow can tolerate that.
    
* **Quota Sharing**: Your on-demand quota is shared across tiers.
    
* **Model Support**: Not all Bedrock models support every tier — check the documentation.
    
* **Tracking**: Use CloudWatch or logging to track how much you’re using each tier — helps with cost governance.
    

---

### Why This Is a Big Win

* You get **granular control** over your Bedrock spending.
    
* You can optimize for both **cost efficiency and performance** at once.
    
* It empowers you to route different parts of your application intelligently — e.g., chat through Priority, batch jobs through Flex.
    

---

## TL;DR

Amazon Bedrock now has **Priority**, **Standard**, and **Flex** tiers — letting you tune each AI request for either speed or savings. Choose the right mix, save money, and still deliver the performance you need.
