Welcome back to our **AWS Networking Ninja Series**! In this second blog post, we‚Äôll dive into one of the most important concepts when it comes to AWS networking: **Public and Private Subnets**. Understanding how to configure these subnets, along with **Internet Gateways (IGW)** and **NAT Gateways/Instances**, is key to ensuring your AWS architecture is both secure and functional.

We‚Äôll cover the differences between **public** and **private subnets**, and explore how to route traffic using **Internet Gateways** and **NAT Gateways/Instances** to ensure your resources have the appropriate level of access to the internet.

By the end of this post, you‚Äôll have the knowledge to design secure and efficient network architectures with proper subnet configurations.

### **What Are Public and Private Subnets?**

#### **Public Subnets**

A **public subnet** is a subnet that is connected to the **Internet Gateway (IGW)**. Resources inside this subnet can send and receive traffic directly from the internet. A classic example of resources in public subnets includes **web servers** and **load balancers**.

#### **Private Subnets**

A **private subnet** is a subnet that does **not** have direct access to the internet. Resources placed in private subnets, like **databases** or **application servers**, are shielded from direct internet traffic. However, they may still need to initiate outbound connections (e.g., downloading patches or accessing external APIs).

#### Key Differences:

* **Public Subnets**: Can directly communicate with the internet.
    
* **Private Subnets**: Cannot directly communicate with the internet.

### **Internet Gateway (IGW): Enabling Public Subnet Connectivity**

An **Internet Gateway** is a horizontally scalable, redundant, and highly available component that enables communication between instances in your VPC and the internet. For any subnet to be considered ‚Äúpublic,‚Äù it must be connected to an IGW.

#### How It Works:

* When you associate a public subnet with an Internet Gateway, resources like EC2 instances can directly send and receive traffic from the internet.
    
* An IGW allows traffic from the **internet** to be routed into your VPC and allows resources within your public subnet to reach the **internet**.
    

#### Example Use Case:

* **Web Servers**: You can place your web servers in a public subnet, so they can be accessed from the internet by end-users via HTTP or HTTPS.
    

#### Key Considerations:

* Ensure your **route table** for the public subnet routes `0.0.0.0/0` (all internet traffic) to the Internet Gateway.
    
* Public instances must have **Elastic IPs** (EIP) or public IP addresses assigned to them to be accessible via the internet.
    

#### Example: Creating a Route Table for Public Subnet:

* **Destination**: `0.0.0.0/0`
    
* **Target**: **Internet Gateway**

### **NAT Gateway vs. NAT Instance: Enabling Private Subnet Connectivity**

Now that we've covered how to route internet traffic to public subnets, let's talk about how **private subnets** can securely communicate with the internet using **NAT Gateways** and **NAT Instances**.

#### **NAT Gateway**:

A **NAT Gateway** is a fully managed AWS service that allows resources in a private subnet to initiate outbound internet traffic (such as accessing external APIs or downloading updates) while preventing inbound traffic from the internet.

* **Highly Available**: NAT Gateways are managed by AWS and automatically scale to meet the demand.
    
* **Cost**: There is a cost for using a NAT Gateway based on the data processed and the time the gateway is running.
    

##### How It Works:

* Resources in private subnets use **NAT Gateways** to route outbound traffic to the internet.
    
* Private instances don‚Äôt require public IPs to access the internet; instead, they send their traffic to the NAT Gateway in the public subnet.
    

#### Example Use Case:

* **Database Instances**: Your database instances in a private subnet may need to download patches from the internet or access external services. They can do this through the NAT Gateway.
    

#### Example: Creating a Route Table for Private Subnet (with NAT Gateway):

* **Destination**: `0.0.0.0/0`
    
* **Target**: **NAT Gateway**
    

#### **NAT Instance**:

A **NAT Instance** is an EC2 instance configured to act as a NAT device. While a **NAT Gateway** is a managed solution, a **NAT Instance** requires you to launch and configure an EC2 instance manually.

##### Key Differences:

* **Management Overhead**: NAT Instances require manual setup, maintenance, and scaling.
    
* **Scalability**: NAT Gateways scale automatically, while a NAT Instance may require you to adjust the instance size or scale out manually.
    
* **Cost**: NAT Instances can be more cost-effective than NAT Gateways, depending on your use case, but they come with more operational overhead.
    

#### Example Use Case:

* **Legacy Applications**: If you have a legacy application that requires a specific configuration or software on the NAT device, you might opt for a NAT Instance.
    

#### Example: Creating a Route Table for Private Subnet (with NAT Instance):

* **Destination**: `0.0.0.0/0`
    
* **Target**: **NAT Instance**

### **When to Use Public vs. Private Subnets**

It‚Äôs important to determine which resources should go into public subnets versus private subnets based on the security and accessibility requirements.

#### **Public Subnet Use Cases:**

* **Web Servers**: Exposed to the internet (e.g., Nginx, Apache servers, Load Balancers).
    
* **Bastion Hosts**: Used to securely access resources in private subnets.
    

#### **Private Subnet Use Cases:**

* **Databases**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc. Typically should not be directly accessed from the internet.
    
* **Application Servers**: Backend services that communicate with web servers or databases but don‚Äôt need direct internet access.
    

#### **Design Tip**:

For enhanced security, **always place your databases and sensitive resources in private subnets**. Use public subnets for your web-facing resources like load balancers and web servers, and isolate them from sensitive backend systems.

### **Security Considerations for Public and Private Subnets**

Securing the traffic between your public and private subnets is critical. Here are some best practices:

1. **Security Groups**: Use Security Groups to control which types of traffic are allowed to and from your instances.
    
    * Example: Only allow inbound HTTP and HTTPS traffic on port 80 and 443 for web servers in the public subnet.
        
2. **NACLs (Network Access Control Lists)**: Use NACLs to provide an additional layer of stateless security.
    
    * Example: Only allow SSH traffic to your bastion host from a specific IP range.
        
3. **VPC Peering or Transit Gateway**: If you need to connect multiple VPCs, consider VPC Peering or AWS Transit Gateway for secure communication between VPCs.
    
4. **Internet Access Control**:
    
    * Don‚Äôt allow unnecessary public IP addresses or internet access for your private instances.
        
    * Only allow specific, controlled outbound internet traffic via NAT Gateways or NAT Instances.

### **Conclusion**

In this blog, we've explored how to configure **public** and **private subnets** in your AWS VPC, how to route traffic with **Internet Gateways** for public subnets, and how to enable private subnets to access the internet via **NAT Gateways** or **NAT Instances**.

We‚Äôve also covered important **security considerations** to ensure your resources are protected in both public and private subnets. Understanding when to use these components and how they interact will help you design more secure and efficient cloud architectures.

In the next post of our series, we‚Äôll delve deeper into the concept of **AWS VPC Endpoints**, focusing on how to securely connect to AWS services without using public IPs.

**Key Takeaways:**

* Public subnets can communicate with the internet via an Internet Gateway.
    
* Private subnets need a NAT Gateway or NAT Instance for outbound internet traffic.
    
* Use **NACLs** and **Security Groups** to secure your VPC resources.
    
* Always design with security in mind: Public subnets should only host resources that require internet access, while private subnets should host sensitive, internal resources.
