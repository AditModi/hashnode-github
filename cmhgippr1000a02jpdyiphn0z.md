Change Data Capture (CDC) has become a foundational pattern in modern data engineering, enabling real-time data synchronization, event-driven architectures, and incremental data pipelines. For data engineers working with AWS customers, understanding why Debezium stands out as the preferred CDC solution is critical to building robust, scalable data platforms.​

## The CDC Challenge

Traditional approaches to capturing database changes fall into two categories: **polling-based queries** and **trigger-based mechanisms**. Polling involves periodically querying the database for changes using timestamps or sequence numbers, which introduces latency (often minutes), creates significant load on production databases, and can miss concurrent updates. Database triggers, while event-driven, add overhead to every transaction, impact write performance, and require invasive changes to application databases.​

Debezium fundamentally solves these problems by capturing database changes at the **transaction log level** without impacting production database performance. This approach taps into the same mechanism databases use for replication and disaster recovery, ensuring every change is captured with millisecond latency while maintaining zero impact on application workloads.​

## Why Debezium Excels

## Transaction Log-Based Architecture

Debezium operates as a distributed platform that reads database transaction logs (binary logs in MySQL, Write-Ahead Logs in PostgreSQL) and converts them into event streams. This architecture provides several critical advantages. First, it captures every data change with **guaranteed ordering and completeness** since transaction logs are the source of truth for all database mutations. Second, it operates with minimal latency—typically milliseconds—enabling true real-time data pipelines.​

## Production-Grade Reliability

For production environments, Debezium supports advanced features like **Global Transaction Identifier (GTID)** for MySQL, which enables seamless failover across database replicas. When combined with Kafka Connect's distributed architecture, Debezium can automatically recover from failures and resume exactly where it left off, preventing data loss or duplication.​

## Schema Evolution Support

Unlike simple log readers, Debezium tracks and manages schema changes automatically, publishing schema evolution events to separate Kafka topics. This ensures downstream consumers can adapt to DDL changes without pipeline failures.​

## Debezium on AWS: Architecture Patterns

For AWS customers, Debezium integrates seamlessly with managed services, reducing operational overhead while maintaining enterprise-grade reliability.​

## Pattern 1: MSK Connect with Aurora MySQL

The most common pattern uses **Amazon MSK Connect** with Debezium connectors to stream changes from Amazon Aurora or RDS databases to Kafka topics. MSK Connect provides fully managed Kafka Connect workers, eliminating the need to provision and manage connector infrastructure.​

## Pattern 2: Kinesis Data Streams Integration

For customers already invested in AWS Kinesis, Debezium Server can write CDC events directly to **Kinesis Data Streams** without requiring Kafka infrastructure. This pattern is ideal for serverless architectures where Kinesis integrates naturally with Lambda, Glue, and other AWS services.​

## Pattern 3: Transactional Data Lakes

Advanced implementations combine Debezium with **AWS Glue Streaming Jobs** to maintain transactional data lakes on S3. Debezium captures inserts, updates, and deletes, while Glue streaming jobs apply these operations to Delta Lake or Apache Iceberg tables, enabling ACID transactions on object storage.​

## Real-World Example: E-Commerce Inventory System

Let me walk through a complete example of using Debezium to build a real-time inventory synchronization system for an e-commerce platform running on AWS.

## Business Requirement

An e-commerce company needs to synchronize inventory changes from their transactional MySQL database (running on Aurora) to multiple downstream systems: a real-time analytics dashboard, a search index in OpenSearch, and a data warehouse in Redshift. The synchronization must happen with sub-second latency to prevent overselling, and must capture every change reliably.​

## Architecture Overview

The solution architecture consists of:

* **Source**: Amazon Aurora MySQL cluster with binary logging enabled
    
* **CDC Layer**: Debezium MySQL Connector running on Amazon MSK Connect
    
* **Streaming Platform**: Amazon MSK (Managed Kafka)
    
* **Processing**: AWS Glue Streaming Jobs
    
* **Destinations**: S3 Data Lake, Amazon OpenSearch, Amazon Redshift
    

## Implementation Steps

**Step 1: Configure Aurora MySQL for CDC**

Enable binary logging on the Aurora cluster and create a dedicated CDC user with replication privileges. Configure the `binlog_format` to `ROW` to capture actual data changes rather than SQL statements.​

```bash
CREATE USER 'debezium'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'secure_password';
GRANT SELECT, RELOAD, SHOW DATABASES, REPLICATION SLAVE, REPLICATION CLIENT 
ON *.* TO 'debezium'@'%';
```

**Step 2: Create Custom MSK Connect Plugin**

Download the Debezium MySQL connector and AWS Secrets Manager Config Provider, package them together, and upload to S3. This custom plugin allows externalizing database credentials in AWS Secrets Manager for security.​

**Step 3: Deploy Debezium Connector**

Create an MSK Connect connector with the following key configuration:​

```bash
{
  "connector.class": "io.debezium.connector.mysql.MySqlConnector",
  "tasks.max": "1",
  "database.hostname": "aurora-cluster-endpoint.region.rds.amazonaws.com",
  "database.port": "3306",
  "database.user": "${secretManager:debezium-credentials:username}",
  "database.password": "${secretManager:debezium-credentials:password}",
  "database.include.list": "inventory_db",
  "table.include.list": "inventory_db.products,inventory_db.stock_levels",
  "topic.prefix": "ecommerce",
  "schema.history.internal.kafka.topic": "schema-changes.inventory",
  "include.schema.changes": "true"
}
```

**Step 4: Process Change Events**

Each inventory change produces a Kafka event with rich metadata:​

```json
{
  "before": {
    "product_id": 12345,
    "quantity": 100,
    "updated_at": "2025-10-20T06:00:00Z"
  },
  "after": {
    "product_id": 12345,
    "quantity": 98,
    "updated_at": "2025-10-20T06:15:23Z"
  },
  "source": {
    "version": "2.4.0",
    "connector": "mysql",
    "name": "ecommerce",
    "ts_ms": 1729404923000,
    "db": "inventory_db",
    "table": "stock_levels",
    "server_id": 223344,
    "gtid": "a8c567d1-8f3e-11ef-9c3d-0a58ac130003:12345",
    "file": "mysql-bin.000042",
    "pos": 154879
  },
  "op": "u",
  "ts_ms": 1729404923234
}
```

The `before` and `after` fields show the state transition, while the `source` metadata includes the GTID for exactly-once processing guarantees.​

**Step 5: Build Streaming Transformations**

Deploy AWS Glue streaming jobs to consume from Kafka topics and apply transformations. For the inventory example, one job updates the S3 data lake using Apache Iceberg for ACID compliance, another updates OpenSearch for search functionality, and a third loads to Redshift for analytics.​

## Production Considerations

**Performance Optimization**: Configure Debezium to read from Aurora read replicas rather than the primary instance to eliminate any potential impact on write workloads. This maintains CDC continuity even during failover events since GTID ensures consistent positioning across replicas.​

**Monitoring**: Track key metrics including connector lag (difference between database transaction time and Kafka publish time), number of events processed, and schema change occurrences. Set up CloudWatch alarms for connector failures and lag exceeding thresholds.​

**Scaling Considerations**: While the Debezium MySQL connector supports only one task due to database connection limitations, you can scale horizontally by deploying multiple connectors for different tables or databases. Use provisioned capacity mode for MSK Connect rather than autoscaling to maintain consistent performance.​

**Handling Schema Evolution**: Configure separate Kafka topics for schema changes and implement downstream consumers that can handle schema evolution gracefully. Use schema registries (like AWS Glue Schema Registry) to validate and version schemas.​

## AWS-Specific Advantages

Working with Debezium on AWS provides several unique benefits. MSK Connect offers fully managed connector infrastructure with automatic scaling, patching, and high availability. Integration with AWS Secrets Manager provides secure credential management without hardcoding sensitive information. Native VPC support enables secure connectivity to RDS and Aurora databases without exposing them to the internet.​

The ability to stream directly to Kinesis Data Streams opens serverless architectures where Lambda functions can process change events without managing Kafka infrastructure. For data lake architectures, the combination of Debezium, MSK, and Glue provides a fully managed CDC pipeline from source databases to S3-based analytics platforms.​

## Beyond Proof of Concept

Many teams successfully run Debezium in local environments using Docker Compose for development and testing. However, production deployments require careful attention to high availability, monitoring, security, and operational procedures.​

Key production readiness checklist items include: enabling GTID for failover support, configuring read replicas as CDC sources, implementing comprehensive monitoring and alerting, establishing backup and recovery procedures for Kafka Connect state, testing failure scenarios including database failover and network partitions, and implementing proper access controls using IAM roles and VPC security groups.​

## Conclusion

Debezium represents a paradigm shift from intrusive, high-latency CDC approaches to a zero-impact, real-time data capture architecture. For data engineers building on AWS, the combination of Debezium with managed services like MSK Connect, Aurora, and Glue provides an enterprise-grade CDC platform that scales from startup to massive enterprises.​

The transaction log-based approach ensures every inventory change, customer update, or order modification flows through your data platform with millisecond latency and zero production database impact. This enables use cases that were previously impractical: real-time fraud detection, instant personalization, synchronized multi-region systems, and truly fresh analytics.​

For organizations serious about real-time data engineering, Debezium isn't just an option—it's the foundation upon which modern event-driven architectures are built.​
