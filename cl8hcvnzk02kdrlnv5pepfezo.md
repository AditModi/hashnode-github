## Top 5 Sessions for AWS Developers at HashiConf Global

👉 The past two years have been challenging due to the pandemic and virtually attending conferences. A physical conference is different, it allows you to spend a few days away from home fully involved in the event—learning, networking, eating, drinking, and possibly even sight-seeing. You go there not only for the material but also to socialise with friends, acquaintances, and complete strangers who wind up becoming pals. Let's hope that this year I can finally attend HashiConf Global in person 🙏

## What is HashiConf Global ?

👉 HashiConf is HashiCorp’s annual community conference where developers, system engineers, architects, and security professionals from organizations of all sizes gather in-person and online to share how the products in HashiCorp’s product stack help them provision, secure, connect, and run their business-critical applications.

👉 Get ready for two days of inspirational speakers, community connection, and a front-row seat to discussing infrastructure and security automation, modern application delivery, and the future of cloud with others who build and use HashiCorp tools every day.

👉 Here are the 5 sessions at the top of my list for HashiConf Global, for AWS Developers!

👉 Before I continue, I should mention that you can get virtual tickets to HashiConf Global [here](), enabling you to remotely join live keynotes and other sessions. There are both live events and virtual events on this list.

### Opening Keynote by HashiCorp Co-Founder and CTO Armon Dadgar, and CEO Dave McJannet - KEYNOTE


**Date:** OCTOBER 05 
**Time:** 09:30 PM - 10:15 PM (GMT+5:30) 
**Session type:** KEYNOTE | IN-PERSON (DIAMOND BALLROOM) AND VIRTUAL (Will be recorded!)
**Description:**

> Join HashiCorp Co-Founder and CTO Armon Dadgar, and CEO Dave McJannet as they kick off HashiConf Global with the Opening Keynote, where you will hear the product updates and announcements that we have in store for you.
> 

👉 Two primary reasons make keynote presentations like these worthwhile to attend: one, they'll cover the essential ideas and takeaways that will be discussed in more detail in other sessions, and second, it's quite beneficial to see how an experienced professional (Like [Armon](https://twitter.com/armon)!) will convey this to large audiences. I advise seeing this session twice as it is available with the virtual ticket and will be recorded.

👉 Watch it once as you usually would (taking note of the novel solutions offered), and then rewatch it from the perspective of a someone who is absolutely unfamiliar with HashiCorp Products. 

👉 If you can only make it to one session, make it this one!

### Terraform AWS Cloud Control Provider – Under the Hood - SESSION

**Date:** OCTOBER 05 
**Time:** 11:15 PM - 11:45 PM (GMT+5:30) 
**Session type:** SESSION | IN-PERSON (PLATINUM F-J)
**Description:**

> AWS Cloud Control API introduced a set of common APIs that enable Terraform AWS Cloud Control provider (AWSCC) to use the latest AWS features and services, typically on the day of launch. Do you want to learn how AWSCC works under the hood? In this session, we will introduce you to the behind the scenes of how AWSCC interact with AWS Cloud Control API and how you can leverage its benefit alongside the regular Terraform AWS provider.
> 

👉 Cloud Control API is a standard set of APIs to Create, Read, Update, Delete, and List (CRUDL) resources across hundreds of AWS Services (more being added) and dozens of third-party services (and growing). 

👉 The HashiCorp Terraform AWS Cloud Control Provider aims to bring Amazon Web Services (AWS) resources to Terraform users faster. The new provider is automatically generated, which means new features and services on AWS can be supported right away. The AWS Cloud Control provider supports hundreds of AWS resources, with more support being added as AWS service teams adopt the Cloud Control API standard. 

👉 This will be a challenging but informative session to attend, and absolutely worthwhile if you have been playing around with Terraform AWS Cloud Control provider (AWSCC) but you're not sure how to integrate them with your Cloud Control API. 

### Deploy Resilient Applications With Service Mesh and AWS Lambda - LEARN LAB

**Date:** OCTOBER 06 
**Time:** 03:00 AM - 03:45 AM (GMT+5:30) 
**Session type:** LEARN LAB | IN-PERSON (PLATINUM A-C)
**Description:**

> This workshop is for practitioners (i.e. developers, network administrators) interested in using a service mesh in Kubernetes and multi-platform environments. You do not need any Consul experience to attend this workshop. 
> 

👉 In this workshop, you will deploy HashiCups, a demo application, and Consul service mesh onto a Kubernetes cluster (AWS EKS). In the process, you will learn how Consul helps organizations securely connect services.

👉 Then, you will dynamically route traffic from a Kubernetes service to a Lambda function, using Consul's service splitter and terminating gateway. By using Consul routing traffic to serverless functions, your application can withstand server outages and unforeseen spikes in traffic.

### Everything, Everywhere, All at Once: Terraform and Indeed's Move to AWS - SESSION

**Date:** OCTOBER 07
**Time:** 12:00 AM - 12:30 AM (GMT+5:30) 
**Session type:** SESSION | IN-PERSON (PLATINUM D-E)
**Description:**

> Indeed had just onboarded Terraform Enterprise, and had been considering a gradual migration to AWS over a 3-5 year time period when the historic Texas power outages in 2021 changed the goal. Now, migration of critical infrastructure needed to move before the end of the year, and Terraform was the best way for teams to move components over. Learn the good, the bad, and the ugly about bringing a large workforce on a deadline to Terraform Enterprise and the cloud.
> 

👉 Learn how Indeed used Terraform Enterprise to adopt, master, and move significant portions of their infrastructure to AWS. I'm sure it will be very helpful if you can make it because [Andrew Noonan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-noonan-93ab95/) has so much expertise and so many interesting anecdotes to share. 
 

### Architecting Geo-Distributed Mobile Edge Application With Consul - SESSION


![Image description](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/gtw0sp63zkettw8p79fw.png)



**Date:** OCTOBER 07
**Time:** 02:00 AM - 02:45 AM (GMT+5:30) 
**Session type:** SESSION | IN-PERSON (PLATINUM D-E)
**Description:**

> There’s been a lot of talk about "the edge" — but what does that really mean in the context of your architecture? How can application teams build highly-distributed K8S applications with nodes separated by thousands of miles? In this session, learn about an architecture that uses Amazon EKS, AWS Wavelength, HashiCorp Consul, and the Verizon 5G network. We will also explore the ways in which Consul can support north-south and east-west traffic patterns within mobile edge environments.
> 

👉 Another difficult but really beneficial session is expected here! One of those things that I know is completely doable and that I've seen colleagues achieve is deploying K8S apps on edge devices. However, I've never done it myself. Exploring this process in further detail would be quite educational and beneficial in the long run.

👉 Spending so much time developing a technically flawless solution without making it inclusive is pointless. At HashiConf this year, you're likely to discover a variety of new AWS products, solutions, or use cases. By attending these talks, you can ensure that your implementations of these fresh concepts are responsible and inclusive. Everyone comes to HashiCorp to learn how to create better goods, and ideally this session will guarantee that when you use your new knowledge, you create those things for everyone.
