### **Introduction**

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) has become a key practice for modern cloud operations, especially when working with AWS. Tools like **Terraform** are widely used to automate the provisioning of cloud resources, but the process can still involve quite a bit of manual work. Recently, I decided to test the **Amazon Q Developer CLI** to see how it could help automate the process of creating an AWS Landing Zone using **Terraform** and ensure best practices for security and scalability.

In this post, I’ll walk through my experience using Amazon Q for this task, what I learned, and how it saved time compared to manual coding.

### **The Goal**

My aim was to use **Amazon Q** to:

* Generate **Terraform code** for a **multi-account AWS setup**
    
* Ensure best practices around **security**, **scalability**, and **cost optimization**
    
* Automate the deployment and management process using **CI/CD tools**

### **How Amazon Q Worked**

I started by issuing a simple prompt to Amazon Q:

*"Generate an AWS Landing Zone with networking, security, and centralized logging."*

Amazon Q didn’t just give me a block of code—it first asked for a few details to refine the setup:

* **Account Structure**: Should I use **AWS Organizations** to manage multiple accounts?
    
* **Networking**: What kind of VPC and subnet structure do I need?
    
* **Security**: Do I need strict IAM policies to enforce least-privilege access?
    
* **Logging and Monitoring**: Should I set up **CloudWatch Logs** and **CloudTrail** for auditing?
    

Once the requirements were clear, Amazon Q began generating the necessary code. Here's how it helped:

1. **Networking**: It recommended setting up **VPCs** across multiple availability zones, using **Transit Gateway** for inter-VPC communication.
    
2. **AWS Organizations**: It guided me through creating multiple accounts using **AWS Organizations**, setting up **Service Control Policies (SCPs)** to ensure security across all accounts.
    
3. **Security**: The tool generated **IAM roles** and **policies** based on security best practices, ensuring that access control was tightly managed across the infrastructure.
    
4. **Logging**: It suggested setting up **CloudWatch** for centralized logging and **CloudTrail** for detailed activity monitoring, ensuring visibility into the environment.

### **Automating CI/CD with GitHub Actions and AWS CodePipeline**

Once the infrastructure was set up, the next step was to automate deployments. Amazon Q suggested integrating **GitHub Actions** and **AWS CodePipeline** to handle Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):

* **GitHub Actions**: I configured a GitHub Action to automatically trigger the Terraform plan and apply steps whenever I pushed changes to the main branch.
    
* **AWS CodePipeline**: I set up a pipeline to deploy the infrastructure changes across multiple accounts, making the process more reliable and repeatable.

### **Reviewing the Terraform Code**

Once Amazon Q had generated the code, I reviewed the output. Here's what I found:

* **Total IaC Files**: 37 files, including modules for networking, IAM, and account management.
    
* **Terraform Code**: 4,120 lines of code, which included all necessary resources like VPCs, IAM roles, and policies, along with the integration of security and logging.
    
* **Security Policies**: 1,235 lines of IAM policies to ensure secure access and governance across the AWS accounts.
    
* **Variables and Outputs**: Proper use of variables allowed flexibility for different environments, and outputs provided useful information such as VPC CIDR blocks and account IDs.

### **The Results: Time Savings and Efficiency**

The key benefit of using **Amazon Q** was the significant reduction in development time. Normally, setting up an AWS Landing Zone manually would take several days of work. With Amazon Q, I was able to cut down the development time by about **80%**. Here's why:

* **Automated Code Generation**: Amazon Q generated most of the Terraform code, which allowed me to focus on refining the setup instead of starting from scratch.
    
* **Best Practices Built In**: The tool made sure that best practices for security, scalability, and cost optimization were followed, which saved me time on validation and testing.
    
* **CI/CD Integration**: By recommending **GitHub Actions** and **AWS CodePipeline**, it simplified the deployment process, making it easier to automate and manage infrastructure changes.

### **Conclusion**

Using the **Amazon Q Developer CLI** for generating a multi-account AWS setup with **Terraform** was a practical and efficient way to automate infrastructure provisioning. It not only saved me time but also ensured that the infrastructure followed security best practices and was easily maintainable.

If you’re working with **Terraform**, **AWS**, or other cloud infrastructure tools, I highly recommend giving **Amazon Q Developer CLI** a try. It’s a useful tool for speeding up infrastructure development and ensuring that best practices are built in from the start.
